Its currently trading at roughly $20. \\n\\nMGNI is in the connected tv business and has recent clients such as Disney and hulu. Its closest comparison is TTD which has a market cap 20x that of MGNI. Revenues of the last quarter for MGNI was 60 million, TTD was 216 million. So TTD has roughly 4 times the revenue of MGNI but is worth 20 times more? I think TTD is too high, but MGNI is also way too low and should easily double from here.\\n\\nI think short term it should get to 28 by February, long term the upside is inverse virgin galactic.',\n",

       " 'THE NEXT BIG THING: CYBERSECURITY. CRWD - FUNDAMENTAL DD INSIDE NFA (Not Financial Advice)\\n\\nHere\\'s another round of some fairly comprehensive fundamental DD on a stock I believe is well positioned to provide many tendies going forward. If you hate reading, but want to spend your parent\\'s inheritance on something that is somewhat defensible / not retarded, skip to the bottom for the bolded call.\\n\\n**I. The Company - CrowdStrike Holdings**\\n\\nIntroducing CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Founded in 2011 by George Kurtz a former Worldwide CTO/EVP @ McAfee & 2 other guys (including a Russian hacking genius, Dmitri Alperovitch), the Company is a cloud native endpoint security provider. Google\\'s venture capital arm initially put in $100mm into the Company & while private, took in funding from a couple big names in the VC/PE space then went public in mid-2019. What the fuck does cloud native endpoint security mean? In an era where everything is shifting to the \\'cloud\\' & more folks work from home, this Company focuses on developing/implementing/selling cloud-based software that provides security to all \\'endpoint\\' devices (laptops, servers, phones, tablets, etc.). Do I need to say more on how big this market opportunity is? Should be common sense at this point. To put some numbers to this - in June 2020, the endpoint security market was estimated to be \\\\~$8Bn total, & adding up the other verticals CRWD participates in, the TAM (Total Addressable Market) of their line of products totals \\\\~$27Bn \\\\[9\\\\], though there are estimates that this is much higher.\\n\\nSo far, CRWD\\'s products protect 49% of the Fortune 100\\'s Company\\'s endpoint devices \\\\[9\\\\], but before I go into more detail on what differentiates CrowdStrike from its competitors, I want to highlight a couple recent themes that are emerging which formed the pillars to my investment thesis.\\n\\n**II. CIO Investment Spending Surveys as of August 2020**\\n\\nAt the beginning & midpoint of each year, the big investment banks conduct surveys from CIOs of major corporations to gain insight into where they intend to invest going forward. Here\\'s a summary of a select few as of 8/2020\\n\\n\\\\-  IT Spending Index fell to 21.5 from 60.5 in 12/2019, which is the lowest level since 2002\\n\\n\\\\- IT budgets set to shrink by \\\\~5%, removing the largest IT budgets (Companies with budgets >$1Bn), set to shrink by \\\\~7% this year \\n\\nSo, IT budgets are overall shrinking & expected to be down. Let\\'s get to the good shit:\\n\\n\\\\- 79% of CIOs believe COVID is acting as a forcing function to make them digitally transform & move to the public Cloud even faster than they had planned with 36% of them increasing their spend in these areas for 2020 & beyond \\n\\n\\\\- Security remains the top spending priority, followed up with Collaboration Applications, Business Intelligence/Analytics, Workflow Automation & Public Cloud \\n\\n\\\\- Within Security, Identity, Firewall, & Endpoint are top priorities - 36% of CIOs polled expect Security spending to accelerate in 2020. Caveat: Is down compared to 10-year average of 38%\\n\\n\\\\- Endpoint screened at #3, down from #1 for the first time since June 2016 - believe drop in ranking is temporary as shift in spending priorities to ensure seamless provisioning/de-provisioning of user rights accesses & secured traffic workflow to corporate network for WFH. This also may be due to the significant decline in PC spending from the 12/2019 survey (21% expected to increase PC spending vs. 33% prior) - more on this below\\n\\n\\\\- Percentage of survey respondents that mentioned \\'endpoint security\\' as a highly prioritized area of security investment expanded from 42.4% in the 1Q\\'20 VAR survey to 81.3% in the 2Q\\'20 VAR survey\\n\\n**III. WTF is Endpoint Security & Comparable Products from a Computer Autist**\\n\\nSince I\\'m fairly new to what the fuck \"cybersecurity\" is, I\\'m assuming most of you autists are as well. Here are my findings on 3 major components of cybersecurity - Identity, Firewall & Endpoint.\\n\\nThink of Identity/Firewall as basically the Security implementations a Company deploys that occur \\'outside\\' of your Company issued device. Basically, it is all the encryption & other shit that secures your user ID/password & engages in the web traffic, etc. you go through.\\n\\nEndpoint on the other hand is basically 2 parts. 1st part is akin to your Anti-Virus bloatware shit that comes pre-installed on most retail laptops, etc. & runs in the background of your device constantly monitoring everything going on to make sure some weird file with an embedded virus doesn\\'t end up on your device. I might get shit from the real cybersecurity folks on this, but I\\'m not an IT guy - I\\'m the user of these devices, I\\'m the one fucking paying you. Your \\'endpoint\\' security thing is software that replaces my anti-virus, so I see it as similar. Deal with it fucking nerds.\\n\\nThe 2nd part is what sets it apart from traditional AV software - which is some magical, computer geek shit that monitors \\'network\\' activity that occurs as your device sends information out of your device & receives information from the web, usb devices, or whatever. This is where the \\'Cloud\\' & \\'AI\\' stuff occurs - a bit more on this later.\\n\\nPicture this: if you\\'ve ever worked on a Company issued device in the past, there\\'s one thing that always sticks out. The AV is fucking annoying - when working with large excel files/presentations, basically anything outside of web surfing/email, there is a noticeable lag that really pisses you off, especially when you\\'re in time-crunch situations & need to get work done quickly. On your personal devices, you can just pause the scans or whatever, but on Company issued devices you\\'ll get random lag spikes & from my personal experience it is usually due to the security bloatware that you cannot uninstall.\\n\\nSo what differentiates CRWD? There are a bunch of benchmarks full of computer-geek jargon but overall, the top products block \\\\~99% of threats & deal with them in their own manners that are OK to me. So what do I want to focus on, & what matters to me as a non-IT employee is efficiency. So, I\\'ve done some research into CRWD\\'s claim that they provide a \\'light-weight\\' solution to all this. I don\\'t give a fuck about how the Samsung Galaxy Note has a pen & all those gimmicks if it isn\\'t executed well. I like my iPhone not because it can do all those weird things Androids can do, I like it b/c out of all the simplistic things I want a phone to do, it does it well, does it without lag, & does it predictably. CRWD seems to aim for this type of experience for the end user while providing top of the line cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe market leaders in the endpoint security space based on market share as of July 2019 are: Symantec (16%), Trend Micro (12%), McAfee (12%) & a few steps down is Crowdstrike (5%) \\\\[6\\\\].\\n\\nSo based on these comps, I want to try to proxy for which of the companies above offer an Endpoint Protection product that fits me, the most likely average user.\\n\\nI\\'m going to proxy the \\'load\\' of each Company\\'s product, proxied by RAM Usage:\\n\\n\\\\- Symantec: 25MB of RAM, takes up \\\\~450MB of hard drive \\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\- McAfee: Claims 75MB of RAM, complaints of 150-200MB+ \\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\- Trend Micro: Requirements of >256MB of RAM, install size of \\\\~350MB \\\\[3\\\\]. They have all these configurations on how to reduce CPU usage but I\\'m going to ignore that as I want to compare standard installs. Google is full of complaints on how much memory usage other Trend Micro products utilize that bogs down computer performance\\n\\n\\\\- **CrowdStrike: \\\\~25MB of your hard drive & uses 2MB of RAM; also consumes 4-6MB of bandwidth/day \\\\[4\\\\]**\\n\\nClearly the winning solution is CrowdStrike. With the previously mentioned finding that there will be a decline of PC buying as a CIO priority, older systems will be utilized for a bit longer than usual going forward. However, the size & complexity of software will continue to demand more & more computing power, paving the path for CRWD implementation as one of the easiest ways for an organization to improve efficiency while retaining the most advanced modern form of cybersecurity - a tailwind many might be overlooking, & something the Sales teams at CRWD are undoubtedly pushing.\\n\\n**IV. What else differentiates CrowdStrike & Total Addressable Market Continued**\\n\\nSo we\\'ve gone over the market opportunity size & why CRWD\\'s main product, Endpoint Security (called Falcon Prevent) would be the preferred choice for regular autistic users like myself, but couple other things:\\n\\n\\\\- On Gartner.com - which reviews & compiles customer experiences of cybersecurity products, CRWD is the most highly rated & has one of the leading \"would recommend\" %s of 98% \\\\[5\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\- While every fucking Company in the Tech space likes to throw around the term \"AI\" & \"Cloud\", these guys are legit in their claims. The reason their Endpoint Security is so lightweight is because it is Cloud-based & is AI-based in its architecture. Meaning - for every incremental customer added, the Endpoint Security collects more data & gets smarter.\\n\\nI\\'ll get into how the Company scales financially later, but it\\'s important to note that the product exhibits similar characteristics. Their product, along with its revenues, will scale with each additional customer added.\\n\\nCRWD\\'s host of products are offered in 10 distinct modules across endpoint security, security & operations, & threat intelligence:\\n\\n\\\\- Endpoint Security: Falcon Prevent (Nextgen AV - AI-based), Falcon Insight (Endpoint Detection & Response), & USB Device Control\\n\\n\\\\- Security & Operations: Falcon Overwatch (Prov. customers with access to dedicated experts - managed threat hunting solution), Falcon Discover (gives deep visibility into endpoints on a customer\\'s network), Falcon Spotlight (IDs unpatched vulnerabilities in real time running on endpoints), Falcon Complete (Comprehensive managed solution)\\n\\n\\\\- Threat Intelligence: Falcon X (Leading threat research & intelligence), Falcon Search Engine, Falcon Sandbox.\\n\\n\\\\- Crowdstrike Store: Provides 3rd party app developers the ability to leverage CRWD\\'s cloud native architecture & lightweight agent to create custom 3rd party apps\\n\\nAll said, CRWD charges $6.99 - $17.99 per endpoint, per month.\\n\\nIn the U.S., it\\'s estimated that there are \\\\~1.2 endpoints per employee at every company in the US with >100 employees. At the aforementioned pricing, this represents potential revenues per year of $8.2Bn - $21.1Bn \\\\[6\\\\]. Remember this is the U.S. only - in 2019, CRWD generated 23% of its revenues outside of the U.S., and as of the most recent quarter, this came in at 27%. Globally, Morgan Stanley predicts the IT security spending market to reach $128Bn; while currently, 24% of IT security spend is spent on Endpoint Security. Putting these 2 together implies a TAM of \\\\~$31Bn. \\\\[8\\\\] All of these calcs from extremely credible sources seem to imply that management\\'s use of IDC\\'s estimate that CRWD\\'s 2020E TAM of $8Bn is an extremely conservative estimate (also something to note: what goes in each Company\\'s investor presentations is highly scrutinized by internal legal counsel, so they play it as safe as they can - unless you\\'re Elon Musk).\\n\\n**V. Financials**\\n\\nCRWD likes to market themselves to the investor community as the category-defining cloud platform for Security. CRM Cloud is dominated by SalesForce, Service Management by ServiceNow, HR by Workday, & Security by CRWD. So from the angle of a SaaS investment opportunity, the main things to focus on are subscription customers, ARR (annual recurring revenue) & billings plus the corresponding growth rates in each of the categories.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s64sdnjqi9j51.jpg?width=895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd78748412a99433eaecb54229b89c42a2c2e8af\\n\\nCRWD as of the most recent quarter has 6,261 customers which grew by +105% YoY, adding +830 from the previous quarter. ARR came in at $686mm which grew +88% YoY. Billings came in at $231mm, representing +90% YoY growth.\\n\\nThis is cool & all, but let\\'s look at some ratios, & how they compare relatively to other SaaS peers.\\n\\nLTV (Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs) ratio -> higher ratio means Company is acquiring new customers at higher levels of profitability & S&M investments will translate to higher profitability over time:\\n\\nCRWD is in the top 5 out of 34 SaaS companies with a LTV:CAC of 5.8x as of the most recent quarter vs. a 2.6x Median across SaaS companies \\\\[6\\\\]\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\nAnother interesting feature is they went EBITDA positive for the 2nd quarter in a row - a first in the Company\\'s history; also want to add their EBITDA went bigly positive, growing by +270% QoQ from barely eeking out EBITDA of $0.3mm a quarter ago.\\n\\nWhat about sales efficiency? This is important as we want to assess the variable costs associated with generating incremental ARR & can be defined as the LTM S&M Expense / New ARR. As of the most recent quarter, CRWD clocks in a ratio of 0.9x, & is in the top 10 out of the 34 SaaS comparables \\\\[6\\\\]\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\n**Final Remarks - Valuation / Is Everything Priced In? & Quick Management Overview**\\n\\nSo far we\\'ve covered the scope & size of the Cybersecurity market, gone over some reasons why CRWD is differentiated, & have shown that their unit economics / business model is being executed at the highest levels. How does all this translate into a stock price?\\n\\nLet\\'s start with market share. Some Wall St. firm estimates that these guys crank out \\\\~$780mm of Revenues this year, & based on Management\\'s conservative view of TAM totaling \\\\~$27Bn this year \\\\[9\\\\], that shakes out to a *paltry 3% market share* for CRWD. Other analysts are pegging Rev. to this \\\\~$770-$780mm mark, & based on everything said about the Company, their recent performance, all of these estimates seem to be *\\'playing it safe\\'* which should result in the Company positioned to \\'beat\\' earnings expectations going forward. If you\\'ve done this autistic earnings play shit for long enough, you\\'ll learn quickly that this is how the game is played; especially for high growth companies.\\n\\nAll of this put together, I am **modeling a near/medium-term share price target of $120 - $135 per Share**. This represents a 21x - 24x EV/Sales multiple on \\\\~$1.3Bn of Sales, which corresponds to a \\\\~4.8% market share. Other SaaS companies like CRM, SHOP, NOW & WDAY trade at an average EV/2021E Sales of 17.4x, with 3-year Rev. CAGRs of \\\\~28%. More importantly, SHOP trades at 33x EV/2021E Sales & has a 3-year Rev. CAGR of 44% & on the low end is SalesForce/CRM (more mature now) which trades at 9.6x EV/Sales with a 21% 3-year Rev. CAGR. The unit economics & current macro backdrop suggests CRWD should be at least a 30% Rev. CAGR company, which warrants the \\\\~20x EV/Sales price target.\\n\\nMore on the Rev figures: \\\\~$1.3Bn of Rev. shakes out to Subscription Customers totaling \\\\~11,800 based on their most recent ARR/Subscription Customer of \\\\~$110k (which is below their \\'19 & \\'20 figures). While this may seem like some insane figure to reach given their most recent quarter had total subscription customers of 6,261, it is easy to make sense of if you think about how at the end of 2019, they had total subscription customers of 2,516 - so from then to now they\\'ve grown by \\\\~2.6x! I will re-evaluate my positions if the stock breaches $140/Share. As a side note: Salesforce went from 10.5% market share in 2008 to 16.4% in 2009, their biggest jump in Company history. These SaaS companies really start to accelerate when shit hits the fan, CRWD is well positioned to mimic this phenomenon.\\n\\nQuick management overview:\\n\\nGeorge Kurtz is their CEO - has \\\\~30% of total Class B shares, controls \\\\~23% of CRWD\\'s voting power. Dude is 49 years old, been doing cybersecurity for nearly 30 years, & prior to CRWD was the worldwide CTO of McAfee. He later resigned from McAfee (where he was undoubtedly probably getting paid millions with a good shot at becoming CEO) to found CRWD with Dmitri Alperovitch & Gregg Marston. There are stories about what prompted the move, & one he usually talks about is how while at McAfee & on an international flight, he saw one of the passengers seated next to him boot up his laptop & wait 15 minutes for the McAfee AV software to load up to begin working. This story jives with my previous observation on the light-weightedness of CRWD\\'s product vs. competitors. Anyway, this dude is definitely in line to produce as many tendies as possible along with us as he has a million shares that vest in 48 equal monthly installments that began on 11/2018 & another 350k shares that vest over 24 equal monthly installments beginning in 11/2022. On top of this, he has $131mm / 2mm additional RSUs that vest in 16 equal *quarterly* installments which began on 12/2018 - meaning this huge chunk of RSUs are starting to hit their stride this year, & you know Kurtz is definitely going to do what it takes to maximize the value of this. \\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] [https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=digestviewer](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=digestviewer)\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] [https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633](https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633)\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] [http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro\\\\_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf](http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[4\\\\] [https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[5\\\\] [https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives)\\n\\n\\\\[6\\\\] Wall Street Research -  July 8, 2019\\n\\n\\\\[7\\\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[8\\\\] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d)\\n\\n\\\\[9\\\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4)\\n\\n\\\\[10\\\\] [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527)',\n",

You will not be able to close your position by increasing the limit price more than the max loss/spread width.\\n\\n\\\\- If holding a spread through expiry and it is ITM (both legs), if RH is unable to close the position due to  less liquid option market and you don\\'t have enough buying power to exercise **ALL OF THE LONG LEGS**, it will end up blowing up your account (multiple times of the spread\\'s max loss) as your short legs will all get exercised and your long legs will not be exercised despite being ITM. This is specially applicable in case of debit spreads (which incurs max profit if expiring in the money).  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n**Apologies for the long post, but I urge anyone who is considering trading spreads or is actively doing so on Robinhood, to give this a read, as you may be caught off guard with this terrifying bug that could wreck your finances. To my fellow autists who don\\'t know what spreads are, and only buy FDs, you may give this a pass.**\\n\\nThe past few days has been an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. But luckily I managed to get out of the dumpster fire relatively unscathed (albeit with a loss of $6k, which I am solely responsible for). I will give you a brief overview of what happened without going too much into the details:\\n\\n\\\\- Opened up a 14DTE position of a bear call (credit) spread, with 100 contracts, credit of 4k, max loss of 6k. Won\\'t go into details, but to give a brief idea, underlying was a company that looked to be doomed at that with fraud allegations on the company and the CEO, and the CEO had to resign. Strikes were opened significantly OTM so the risk seemed very less.\\n\\n\\\\- Within a couple of days, despite a slew of bad news and media coverage, the underlying went up like crazy. Nobody in their rational mind could understand why. I guess that\\'s the risk that I had ignored (trading a meme stock that has a mind of it\\'s own). Long story short, 4DTE, my spread was deep in the money (like 70-80 delta). I still didn\\'t close my position at a loss because I thought this was merely a short squeeze and would end soon. Oh boy, was I so wrong.\\n\\n\\\\- At the end of the day, I had been assigned 1/100 contracts. I have been trading spreads for some time now, and usually close early with a profit or loss. This is the first time I had gotten assigned (like ever). I thought that RH would exercise one of my long legs in response, but it didn\\'t. Instead, I manually queued up an exercise for the next day as it was after hours. This assignment led to a short position of around 3k, and I had enough buying power to cover it, so it didn\\'t lead to an account deficit or margin call.\\n\\n\\\\- Next day 3 DTE, my exercise went through.Tried closing my position at 95% max loss. Order didn\\'t get filled. Fortunately, didn\\'t get assigned after hours.\\n\\n\\\\- Next day, 2DTE, I decided I had had enough and opened a buy to close order for max loss. My order was only partially filled, with only 10/99 contracts closed. After hours, I was assigned 65 contracts (out of the remaining 89). This time, it was a margin call of 200k+. I didn\\'t have buying power to cover it. RH didn\\'t exercise my long legs this time either. I was super anxious and mailed RH support regarding this issue. This looked eerily similar to the Alexander Kearns story. Anyways, queued up an exercise for the 65 contracts to cover the margin call.\\n\\n\\\\- Next day, 1 DTE, exercise went through. I held 24 positions. Seemed like the options were very illequid  as even my max loss buy to close wasn\\'t going through. I tried entering a higher limit price (more than the max loss), but RH wouldn\\'t let me. Later I got to know from the support (who took until the end of the next trading day to get back), who confirmed that this is indeed a **bug with Robinhood where your buying power isn\\'t restored even if you cover your margin call until the next trading day**. After hours, i got assigned another 10 contracts. Another margin call. As expected, no auto exercise from RH again. Margin called again. Queued up another exercise for 10 contracts.\\n\\n\\\\- Expiry day. With 14 contracts remaining and the margin call covered, I put 2 and 2 together that if I couldn\\'t close my position by EOD, I would end up losing more than the max loss because RH wouldn\\'t exercise my contracts due to the lack of buying power, despite it being way ITM. So essentially, my long leg would expire worthless, and because my short strike being around $7 ITM, I would end up losing $7\\\\*1400 = $9800 (if I had to cover my short position after the weekend, assuming the stock opened at the same price). Thats a total loss of $15800 if you take the loss of the spread into account. Tried to close at max loss again, order won\\'t go through after multiple hours. Tried increasing limit price, RH wouldn\\'t let me due to the bug described above. Frantically tried contacting the support over twitter/email, but no one reached out. I had RH gold, but didn\\'t enable margin. Turned it on, and surpisingly, my margin was shown negative (lol, what\\'s even the point of this app when it\\'s all bugs).\\n\\nThis is how it looked like:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf6w19ux8ks51.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d61248d1febbca903b18460137b97e5bccbb09a\\n\\n **Finally, as a last ditch effort, I liquidated about 90% of my portfolio to cover for an exercise of my 14 remaining long positions. Shitty thing to do, but had to be done. EOD, the 14 short positions were exercised. I was relieved that this ordeal was over.**\\n\\nLessons learnt:\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m done with RH. With such a shitty support, if anything goes wrong, you are left with your d\\\\*\\\\*k in your hand. Other platforms may not be free but it is well worth the peace of mind. I\\'m considering between TDA/Fidelity, any suggestions are welcome.\\n\\n\\\\- Don\\'t trade meme stocks. It\\'s literally murphy\\'s law with those.\\n\\n\\\\- Close your spreads early, regardless of a potential loss. Always remember that \"Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\".

My company has also interest in adding PCG because it holds up well in a down market at these prices.\\n\\n-Big named funds like Appaloosa and Baupost committed to adding more shares. Since this is one of the biggest bk exits in the U.S., there is a long list of underwriters such as Goldman, Morgan, and others that will accumulate shares. Institutions and funds love when big name players get into a ticker.\\n\\n-The current issue will set a floor, this will likely get pumped up to get a higher close before 7/1. $10 is a strong support w/ a confluence of price & trend lines. Shares should stabilize here and possibly climb closer to $12 by 7/1 because the victims' trust value can not fall further under the 6.75 billion amount. There will be backlash if that were the case; PCG, institutions, and all interested parties will only benefit by buoying up the stock price.\\n\\n-Indicators show extreme oversold, while at the same time accumulation for buyers. Short sellers have taken advantage of the uncertainty before bankruptcy exit to shake out weak hands. However with a near dated certainty now, the profit potential for shorts has waned because there can be price spikes any moment.\\n\\n-Likely see some form of a short squeeze\\n\\n-Our valuation of a forward P/E ratio of 2.52, also EPS growth is accelerating, so growth in the next 2 years will be better than the last few.

Two things to note from that: Firstly, Nvidia will want to desperately diversify their income and, secondly, Nvidia will struggle to achieve much year-on-year growth in the gaming market, as they are already dominating with 73.5% of steam users (A video game platform) using an Nvidia card \\\\[4\\\\].\\n\\n# What market(s) does Nvidia want to grow and diversify into?\\n\\nNvidia\\'s next big market is high-performance computing. In the fiscal year 2020 \"data centre\" accounted for 27.3% of revenue \\\\[3\\\\], so Nvidia is already in this market. That this market is a focus for Nvidia can be seen in their acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which designs networking equipment used in data centres. Their core product, GPUs, is also well suited with ever more scientific computing, technical computing, and general data processing algorithms running primarily on GPUs.\\n\\nNvidia is also interested in mobile-computing and GPU applications used in-game consoles (Nintendo Switch) as-well-as automotive applications. (Automotive making 6.41% of revenue in FY20 \\\\[3\\\\])\\n\\n# How does ARM help Nvidia in their wants?\\n\\nIn data centres ARM is well suited for being the primary CPU architecture used, due to the architecture\\'s much better energy efficiency of x86. Nvidia already powers many of the most energy-efficient supercomputers and the ARM architecture can play an important role to further this. Energy efficiency is super important, as cooling and power consumption make a combined 71% of facilities cost \\\\[5\\\\].\\n\\nAs mentioned above, ARM powers 95% of mobile devices, so the engineering expertise will be of much use to Nvidia, if they want to develop in the automotive industries.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nNvidia has shown keen interest in developing markets in which ARM\\'s technology expertise will be very useful. Nvidia also doesn\\'t run into the same regulatory problems someone like Apple might, as their core product and competitors core product do not directly rely on ARM technologies.\\n\\nWith ARM under their belt, Nvidia will be one of the most technologically advanced chip designers and will start winning (more) in high-performance compute and mobile processing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Edit: Positions\\n\\nRight now it\\'s waiting for some events to unfold. AMD Radeon will release their \"Nvidia killer\" GPU \"Big Navi\" sometime in 2020 - rumour is October \\\\[6\\\\]. If the GPU is going to be better than Nvidias new GPUs is anyone\\'s guess, but we should wait for them to release because:\\n\\nIf AMD makes an amazing GPU, then Nvidia\\'s stock will plummet (at the latest when earnings are released). If that happens, then I will load up on some juicy Nvidia in the dip and hold them.\\n\\nIf AMD\\'s \"amazing\" GPU is dog shit, then Nvidia\\'s stock will be unaffected (I doubt it will go up just because of that, as AMD\\'s GPUs have been subpar for the last years). In that case, I\\'ll load up on Nvidia before their own new GPUs are released.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Tl;Dr:**\\n\\n**Nvidia will buy ARM from SoftBank, and thereby become one of the most advanced chip designers.

The Bids/Asks surpassed this limit price for quite some time, but my order still didn't go through (i.e it said 'Order Pending'). So I cancelled the order, and placed another one, this time an order that was 10% lower than the current bid. Waited 15 minutes, and it still didn't fill. I placed a third order, this time at Market, and it didn't fill. I called RBC DI and waited 1 hour to reach a rep.

He called a manager who then cancelled my order and sold it on the market immediately. Unfortunately, when I was trying to sell it, it was hovering between 8.5-9.5 USD/Contract. By the time I finally got through to the manager, this number was 6.5-7.5 and the manager closed my position at 6.63.

       " 'Battery day is checkmate for fossil fuels A lot of this post is speculation based on the leaks of the battery design, so keep that in mind.\\n\\nElon’s been stressing for months how big of a deal battery day will be. He’s not hyping. The tech they are releasing is a big fucking deal and the death knell for the fossil fuel industry.\\n\\nImages leaked of a cell that’s been estimated to have 5x the volume of their 2170 cell used in model 3, leverages dry electrode manufacturing technology from Maxwell, and features a tabless design. Let’s break this down:\\n\\n1) Power density.\\nWhen Tesla moved from 18650 cells in model s to 2170 cells in model 3, they increased the amps per battery by 2x bc they increased volume by half (150%). Assuming the same battery chemistry as today’s batteries, that nets you a 16x increase in amperage per cell over the 2170. Expand that to the battery pack level (and account for the reduction in number of cells while maintaining voltage) and you get ~800-900 ampHrs per pack at the same voltage, a 4x improvement over current model 3 at 215 ampHrs.\\n\\nYou can use this power in a few ways. One is higher torque performance, useful in a semi truck or high performance sports car. One is cost, you can use less cells by volume and achieve the same performance as the existing model 3, although this sacrifices range (we’ll get there). The big one is higher charging speeds. The new batteries can charge 4x faster. 30 min charge to 5-10 min charge. You also get higher recapture rate from the breaking/energy recovery system. Tesla can waste less energy breaking the car and reuse more than ever before.\\n\\n2) Energy density.\\nTesla will be using dry electrode technology in their new cells. Numbers have not been leaked here, we’ll have to wait until battery day to get the details. But the concept is important to understand regardless. Not only does a dry electrode increase energy density per cell, the technology also simplifies manufacturing and extends the charge/recharge life of the battery. I would not be surprised to see that this new tech enables a million mile battery.\\n\\n3) What’s tabless?\\nNormally, electricity in a battery must travel in circles around the inside of the battery until it reaches the outside and can be discharged. Tabless design allows Tesla to suck energy directly from anywhere in the cell.\\n\\nThis reduces heat substantially, which means the same cooling system can be used to cool a bigger cell.\\n\\nAnd if you know anything about thermodynamics, you know that heat = inefficiency in energy usage. Tabless design, therefore, will bring an increase in energy density of the cell because you don’t lose as much to heat. While maintaining cost parity in battery management systems. Big deal.\\n\\nTabless also allows up to 10x current increase from the cell, because you can pull and put energy anywhere equally. So now you’re looking, at same range as today, a 40x increase in available amps if they use the same volt to amp ratio in their pack design as they do today.\\n\\n4) Pack internal redesign.\\nI’m going to skip the gritty details of how the ratio between amps and volts work, but the high level version is that more batteries in series means more volts. More batteries in parallel means more amps. Got it?\\n\\nObviously, Tesla has no use for the level of amps they can pull under the current design. It’s just not practical. So let’s redesign the internals.\\n\\nIf instead of maintaining the same series/parallel ratio as the model 3, Tesla will lean more heavily on series and put less batteries in parallel. Why? Because now you can increase the voltage available across the pack and not waste the stupid level of amps where they aren’t necessary.\\n\\nOkay so why does that matter? Because more amps means a thicker charging cable. Elon has also been talking about actively cooled charging cables for the supercharging stations. If you can increase the voltage into the battery on the charging side, you can maintain the 5-10min charge time without massively increasing the thickness of the charging cable and handle the heat by actively cooling the charging cable.\\n\\nAre you putting the pieces together yet...\\n\\nCOST:\\nWhat does this mean for the bottom line? Nothing short of monumental.\\n\\nFirst, let’s disregard dry electrode and tabless. Purely on cell numbers, you see a 80% decrease in cell cost per pack. Between model s and model 3, Tesla was able to manufacture cells for the same price and was therefore able to reduce the cost of the pack. If they can do it again, that means an 80% reduction in cell cost and ~8% reduction in price of the car.\\n\\nReintroducing the dry electrode and tabless, some of this will no doubt contribute to their ability to produce the cells at the same price, but the innovations in manufacturing from Maxwell point at a cheaper price per cell than parity. There’s no numbers here, so I’m going to bump the reduction in car cost to 10%.\\n\\nThere’s a bunch of little things as well. Cell to pack instead of cell to module to pack is a small improvement on manufacture and reduces the weight of the car. Vertically integrated production is again, a small improvement that mostly pays out in reliability, innovation speed, and economies of scale.\\n\\nAdd all this together, Tesla is looking at an overall price reduction of 10-12% per vehicle, and the vehicles will last much longer at initial range.\\n\\n——\\n\\nICE is fucked. The $40k model 3 is now $35k. The $35k model 3, which today is impractical, suddenly can be dropped closer to 32k and be made practical. The vehicles last longer than 10 years at peak performance with very low maintenance. The semis outcompete every existing semi by a wide margin. The roadster can go sub 1.8. \\n\\nThe energy storage division can handle equivalent loads for 20-40% less. Say goodbye to natural gas peaker plants. Solar + battery all of a sudden is at parity or below fossil fuel based electricity generation. Climate change is almost fully solved.\\n\\nElon has called checkmate.',\n",

As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.\\n2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.\\n3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.\\n4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and >1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.\\n5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.**\\xa0South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore,\\xa0research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms.\\xa0\\n\\n**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.\",\n",

I want to talk about Bank of America stock, the stress tests, and PPP Loans. \\n\\n for people who don't know how banks record loan losses i'll give a quick primer.  Banks take future predicted losses against todays earnings.  So if the bank needs 3% of their loan totals in the loan loss account, and they only have 2.5% in there, it will come out of that quarters earnings even though they didn't lose any money yet.  They just predict they will lose that amount sometime in the future. \\n\\non Jan 1 Bank of america voluntarily adopted new basel accord requirements for loan loss reserves.

       " 'Weird Stuff Going on With USO On this week\\'s special edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we\\'ll be going over some funky shit that\\'s going on in the USO ETF, and what may be the biggest arbitrage opportunity in the history of the stock market, driven by dumb retail investors pouring money into ETFs that they don\\'t understand.\\n\\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don\\'t buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\\n\\n**Brief Background**\\n\\nIn case you’ve been in a coma for the past few days, you’ve probably already probably know about the crash in oil prices and what $USO is. It’s an extremely popular Oil ETF and used as a mechanism for retail investors to speculate on the price of oil without actually needing to deal with futures, and potential complications that come with them like negative prices and being forced to accept delivery - something a lot of people probably found out about yesterday. This Oil ETF has grown to be massively popular in the past few days. Here’s some of their stats as of April 21 2020 closing from their website.\\n\\n[USO 4\\\\/21 Stats](https://preview.redd.it/kb79o4jzz9u41.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee37a1d967c134a83367ba3cc987d4703482f0d)\\n\\n**Buying The Dip**\\n\\nThey’ve got almost $3 ~~Trillion~~ Billion (apparently, I\\'m dyslexic) in Net Assets, most of which came in the past few weeks as a massive flood of retail investors came in to “buy the dip”. They went from 156 million shares outstanding at Feb 29 to 1.1 billion shares on April 20th. We’ll go back to how that works and why that matters later. They’ve also become extremely popular on Robinhood, with it being the top bought stock recently, which I (subjectively) take it as a red flag.\\n\\n[Robinhood users holding USO](https://preview.redd.it/3r2jmum30au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=116a24ea155ac86ed266f9fe77db6ae7fc03bded)\\n\\nThis spike in demand has been causing this ETF to have several problems recently. A few days ago, it became so big that it held 25% of all front-month oil futures outstanding, forcing it to restructure what assets it held because of regulations. There\\'s also theories out there that the fact that USO holds so many contracts was one of the causes of the May contract crashing so dramatically yesterday. Today, demand for their shares increased to the point where they were temporarily no longer able to issue more shares until the SEC approved the registration of new shares they filed yesterday. The caused USO to no longer reflect anywhere close to what the true price of the underlying assets.\\n\\n**How USO Works**\\n\\nUSO, currently as structured, ~~holds 80% of their value in front month futures and 20% in second month futures~~ (won\\'t be true in a few days, see edit below). In theory, the ETF price should equal the value of the shares of the underlying assets, right? Well, that’s not what happened today.\\n\\nLook at the “Premium Discount” number. This is the percentage the ETF’s market value is over or under the actual underlying asset. It’s supposed to be extremely small, at least when markets make sense. But the amount of “buy the dip” bulls irrationally bought USO shares, causing the price dislocation we see today, where USO is worth 36% more than the underlying asset.\\n\\n[Q4 USO Premium \\\\/ Discount Day Count](https://preview.redd.it/5hy319k80au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aca9b8dd1f7ec7683b318a64f11d3226280c4fa)\\n\\nIn normal markets, seeing a premium or discount of more than 1% for USO is pretty rare, and the ETF price usually reflects the actual oil futures. Usually, when there is a premium between the ETF price and Net Asset Value, USO’s Authorized Purchasers would purchase more of the underlying assets and issue additional shares until the ETF market price is the same as the asset’s price, giving them a nice arbitrage opportunity to make easy money. The problem is that the sudden spike in bulls trying to bet on oil made it so that this mechanism cannot be used until the SEC approves the registration of the new shares they need to do this.\\n\\nSo, what happens when USO\\'s share registration does get approved? USO\\'s Authorized Purchasers will start printing new shares like they’re JPowell trying to cure COVID-19 with his money printer until USO drops enough (i.e. to $2.06, or whatever the NAV is) to reflect the actual prices of the futures they hold. This seems to be the rare instance of arbitrage in the stock market, and I’m kind of shocked some hedge fund hasn’t taken advantage of this by shorting USO.\\n\\n**Why hasn\\'t anyone taken advantage of this yet?**\\n\\nOkay, so there\\'s a clear arbitrage opportunity here, why hasn\\'t some MM or hedge fund taken opportunity of this? I was wondering this too, and jumped on a call with a friend who works in the ETF space, so here\\'s my best understanding of what he explained to me. Say you\\'re managing billions of dollars and you see this, knowing that the SEC will be approving the share registration in a few days. Seeing the oil prices the past few days you don\\'t want any oil exposure, so you don\\'t want to take the risk of short oil and thus can\\'t short USO outright. If you want to take advantage of this, while remaining neutral on oil, you would short USO while buying the underlying futures to hedge against changes in the oil prices. The problem with this is now you\\'re holding oil futures for June, which you found out yesterday can in fact go negative and you might have difficulty unwinding your trade, which itself is too much risk for you to take, so you stay out of it.\\n\\nLinks to sources in comments because automod blocks this post if I add them here.\\n\\nTLDR; Dumb bulls are pumping USO to the point where its price no longer reflects actual oil prices because USO is waiting for SEC approval to correct it (which according to my ETF friend takes a day or two). USO 2.50p 4/24 and pray that oil futures don\\'t go up more than 36% in the meanwhile.\\n\\nEDIT - Apparently, USO announced today that is now changing their holdings to be 40% June, 55% July, 5% August, although it doesn\\'t look like they\\'ve started the process of rolling their futures yet, which might affect things, although the NAV should theoretically be the same\\n\\nEDIT2 (4/22, 10AM) - June futures is up 40% and USO is down 5% as I write this, which basically eliminates most of the NAV premium, still overvalued by about 15% using back-of-the-napkin calculations, going to start closing out my positions. Whatever hedge funds did this trade while remaining neutral oil (i.e. hedged by going long on futures while short on USO) just made alot of money. Keep in eye out for future opportunities to profit of off greedy \"buy the dip\" bull retail investors next time June futures go down.\\n\\nEDIT3 - SeekingAlpha wrote an article that basically reiterates the contents of this post - [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339102-uso-now-detaching-from-reality](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339102-uso-now-detaching-from-reality)\\n\\nEDIT 4 - Did more research and found out it actually usually takes up to 5 - 6 business days for SEC to review S-3s in particular. Can take up to a month if they have comments / concerns about it.',\n",

Now however, third time around, no, I\\'m not making the same mistake of playing with everything in my account.\\n\\nIf you have any questions ask away. Hope you find this post inspiring. God speed to all you beautiful retards and keep grinding.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\\n\\nI started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.\\n\\nHold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.\\n\\nGo into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration\\n\\nLearn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the  IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.\\n\\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda\\'s. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.\\n\\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don\\'t put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I\\'d feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.\\n\\nDo not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn\\'t mean you need follow the ultra-retards.\\n\\nDon\\'t hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn\\'t fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.\\n\\nLEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.\\n\\nI\\'ll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don\\'t kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.\\n\\nEDIT 2:\\n\\nI will say this.  My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I\\'m finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.\\n\\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\\n\\nEDIT 3:\\n\\nI usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.\\n\\n10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.\\n\\nEDIT 4:\\n\\nIf you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there\\'s one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\\\\~ or so from this.\\n\\nBut then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.\\n\\nLearning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to \"outsmart\" the market. You\\'re going to lose you fucking shirt.\\n\\nEDIT 5:\\n\\nThe gay mods flaired me with...drum roll, a gay flair. Thx.\\n\\nEDIT 6:\\n\\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \\\\~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity.\\n\\nEDIT 7:\\n\\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there\\'s a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it\\'s because I used that logic.',\n",

Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month’s record highs.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to “stabilize key national industries,” according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is “very special” to him. The president added, “I’m not sure that’s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.” He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be “based on hard facts and data” and will be “grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.”\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy’s more than 69,100 cases are second only China’s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy’s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles’ household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> * Target, one of the retailers that’s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it’s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate.

       " 'Your KODK Update, Losers Recap: So, KODK has been a $2.50 stock since about mid-2019, since nobody buys fucking film anymore. Quarterly revenue had generally beebop\\'ed between 250M and 320M for the past several years, with the exception of Q2 2020, which was 213M, a thwack of 30% instead of it\\'s normal slow death of 10-15%. So in standard format, theta gang have been selling covered calls on this stock for around 9 months while KODK continues it\\'s slide into obscurity.\\n\\nBut fuck that. On **July 28, 2020,** KODK released that they were to the recipient of a 765M loan from the Trump administration, and the stock mooned 2,570+%. This loan was part of a larger defense production act effort to get the United States back to homegrown pharma supplies. As part of the deal, KODK announced they would be building this pharma capability in Rochester, New York and St. Paul. In other words, fuck acquisitions, we\\'re fucking KODK we\\'ll build out our own pharma capability....with blackjack, and hookers, and look at the size of my...\\n\\n...nevermind, because apparently the chodes at KODK are far too greedy even for degenerate Western sensibilities. They set up stock options and grants for themselves and probably family, and friends and random drunks at the shitty bars they pass out and mumble in, and made a fuck-ton of fuck-you money on the fucking-market trading ahead of the fucking-announcement. Viola, the KODK deal is halted, and even the White House trade advisor Pete Navarro had to comment \"what happened at Kodak was probably the dumbest decisions made by executives in corporate history\".\\n\\nApparently fucking over a bunch of DC insiders by not letting them know about the deal was enough, and all plans for the 765M Double Pump of Assets (DPA) of  (3 x Q2 revenue) are halted pending an SEC investigation, a House inquiry, a Senate circle-jerk, and Aunt Prina\\'s scolding and knuckle-rapping with her wooden spoon.\\n\\nSo, to the analysis...  The stock moon was clearly a mad scramble to cover positions devastated by the rapid rise of the price. KODK has since established a slow fade of 5%-10% per day to avoid circuit breakers, and to give those who have been forced to take positions a means of spreading losses. What this means for us autists is that the rate of KODK\\'s fall has been pretty well pegged to the theta decay of the majority options in play. This means that you log in every morning and find your KODK put options position is effectively even, no loss, no gain. IV crush, in other words. Aside from spikes here and there, you will likely hold these options to expiration with few little gains, and anything below 7 will expire OTM.\\n\\nHope for the loan continues since the price hasn\\'t fallen back to previous levels, buoyed as well by the positions taken by the losers from the spike on July 28th. I say this because the loan is 3x the quarterly revenue, and 7 is about 3x the usual stock price. If you have a put position below here, put your money in an envelope for the other guy. There is just too much going on that is keeping the stock above $7.\\n\\nMy prediction is simple:\\n\\n1. Up to August 21 KODK will stay at or around 7.00/share. If you loaded up on $2, $3, adn $4 strikes expecting a fast correction, nerrrrp.\\n2. Those who sold options for August 21st ahead of the announce on the July 28th (they\\'ve been selling options for 8/21 since at least July 6th, well ahead of the insanity) are not going to be rewarded with a return to 2.50/share.  Good luck, you sold those $5 strikes naked for .15 and now you get to buy them back at $2.00 on friday. I hope you\\'ve been hussling.\\n3. Next week, I predict the slow fade to be effectively over, and we\\'ll see some smart plays emerge with realistic valuations of KODK based on 1) the lead time and investment to get a pharma operation up and running 2) the actual deliverance/non-deliverance of the loan and the terms 3) changes within KODK (hirings, firings, and restructures) to support a major mission change.\\n\\nPositions:\\n\\n1.

As a real state investment trust, Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) concentrates on acquiring, owning and managing specialized industrial properties for regulated state-licensed cannabis facilities. In recent years the increasing acceptance of cannabis for medical & recreational uses has fueled demands for the product and in turn more and more cannabis facilities are popping up around the states. IIPR is well positioned to take advantage of this growing trend.\\n\\nI present below the grounds on which I believe this stock is poised for exceptional growth.\\n\\nIncreasing earnings:\\n\\nOne of the most common elements in stocks that post large gains is the increasing earnings in recent quarters.

This exceptional earnings trend and its consistency for the past 4 quarters shows that IIPR has fuel to rocket upward in the near future.\\n\\nTight trading range and accumulation: [Daily chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-05pZodborak/X3_UHAajHmI/AAAAAAAAAAw/oAChKnEM83gJ79gdGo3zZS_LtIxVIYVbwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)\\n\\nThe stock is also exhibiting signs of money inflow and accumulation. In the daily chart above it can be noticed that that shares have been trading steadily in a range between $115 and $130 since mid August on higher\\xa0than usual volume. Also, the range of daily price move has been smaller compared to the trend seen before August. This pattern usually is observed before a major upward breakout.\\n\\nSteady base and impending breakout: [Weekly chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iqDJSEKdBX4/X3_WTu9jXyI/AAAAAAAAAA8/VZgjk_Ov9dE4nvTENgWRgMwYOQHMtxnkQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)\\n\\nIts can be seen from the weekly chart above that after hitting a high of ~$132 in July 2019 the stock price has consistently traded below this value and formed a double bottom\\xa0W\\xa0pattern. A decisive breakout above $132 a share on high volume is all that is needed to thrust the stock in a rapid upward trend. Interestingly,\\xa0just this week the stock price has started to really test the resistance at $132.\\xa0It would be wise to keep an eye out on this stock on Friday and in the coming week for a breakout. This breakout should be the entry point to open any new position. Make sure the volume is high on the the day it breaks out or else it may just be a false signal.\\n\\nTo sum up, IIPR is presenting very strong bullish signals and might skyrocket after a high volume breakout above $132 a share. I would suggest a target selling price of $200 to $220 a share by end of next year. Let me know your thoughts.\",\n",

There is still a ton of potential in this play, and room to climb, so don\\'t worry, but had to get that out for the Retards that will come in and say great DD after it mooned, blah blah, fuck you. \\n\\nWhat is CHEWY?\\nChewy operates in pet food, supplies, medications, health products and other pet services (whatever the fuck those are).\\n\\nChewy is one of the few stocks that didnt tank with Covid. \\nOn Jan 1st 2020, their stock was at 29.62.\\nOn March 12th they closed at 22.77, their lowest point this year. As we know the Market bottomed on the 23rd...\\nAs of March 23rd, their stock was up to 32.14, higher than the beginning of the year....\\n\\nChewy has actually seen tremendous growth because of Covid and that has helped their stock to surge as more and more people turn to online ordering for their pet food. Also, as we all know, most white people care for their dogs more than other people, we even let them sleep in the bed. So naturally, they were well taken care of and that included medications and food, from Chewy.\\n\"According to Packaged Facts, approximately 90% of dog owners and 86% of cat owners in 2018 considered their pets to be a part of their family.\" - Probs all white people surveyed cause we are GAY - Fuck cats tho\\n\\nNow some growth for Chewy:\\nFrom Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/04/02/pet-retailer-chewy-well-positioned-to-benefit-from-surge-in-online-demand/#4f5fb04c5d7f\\n\\n\"Online pet retailer Chewy didn’t wow Wall Street with the fourth quarter results it released today, but the surge in demand it is seeing right now makes it well positioned to weather the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nChewy is hiring between 6,000 and 10,000 employees at its fulfillment centers to handle a spike in orders, both from existing customers who are stockpiling pet food and supplies, and new customers, CEO Sumit Singh told investors in a conference call following the results release today after the market closed.\"\\n\\n\"For the fourth quarter of 2019, the results reported today were largely in line with expectations, with sales for the quarter up 34.7% over the prior year, at $1.35 billion and a net loss of $60.9 million, which included share-based compensation of $45.9 million.\\n\\nThose results include sales through Feb. 2, the last day of the fourth quarter, and don’t reflect the surge Chewy has been experiencing since the coronavirus crisis hit.\"\\n\\nNone of the Covid surge has been reflected in previous earnings, so hold on tight boys. \\n\\nThey are hiring like crazy, meaning sales are through the roof. They have an expected EPS of (.01), thats negative .01 for the retards. \\n\\nNow naturally, and as the Forbes article explains, with hiring comes costs, such as labor costs, and of course there are more sanitation costs for COVID. But, outlook is supreme right now, and the view of them surging and revenue will be insane. \\n\\nTheir Sales have climbed from 2 Billion to 3.5 to 4.8 Billion from 17 - 19. They have of course been operating at a net loss, since inception, but that is shrinking every year, down to -252 Million for the end of 19. \\t\\n\\nThey also have great customer retention and are increasing $ per customer every year, and I have to imagine that climbs for the last quarter. \\nTheir customer base has gone from 6.7 Million to 13.5 million from 17 - 19. \\nTheir net sales per customer is up from $310 to $360 in that same time frame, and their autoship keeps climbing, going from 61% of sales to 69% of sales.\\n\\nThese are all really good signs, and last quarter should be even higher. \\n\\nThis stock has a lot of potential long term. Brick and Mortar stores are already in trouble. Covid has accelerated this concern, and Chewy is benefiting BIGLY. My price target for earnings is 45 strike price, but long term, for the few of you idiots who can look long term or buy farther out strike prices, this has upwards of $50 potential end of year (IMO).\\n\\nTL:DR:\\nChewy goes up BIGLY. \\nPositions:\\nCHWY 6/19 45C\\n170 Shares of EVRI\\nEVRI 6/19 10C (I moved up from the 7.5C I posted yesterday, but may move back down depending on volume, as I\\'m not liking the 10 as much).

For those of you who are trying to process what is happening right now let me break it down for you. \\n\\nTesla= What Netflix did to Blockbuster. And blockbuster is currently ever vehicle manufacture on the planet right now. You just don’t see it yet. \\n\\nThe other day I posted a thoughtful question regarding the long term consequences in the event that Elon created a new ground breaking battery and what that effect that would have on big oil/other vehicle manufactures. The responses varied. \\n\\nSome of you are mad about this solely because you lost money on the stock in the short term. You failed to account for the fact that Tesla is already worth 40% of the entire ***market cap*** which means the market has already priced this day in. The good news is it's only going to get better from here. \\n\\nAny company that did not already make the necessary pivot to the EV world is completely fucked. Any of them that did make the pivot will now have to forget everything known about battery tech and start from scratch. This 25k vehicle with the advanced battery and imporved recharge time, extended range, and the fact that it's all made in house and from an abundant resource is going to change the game forever. Also, very few people go from electric back to gas driven so that means every person they grab is a permanent EV driver. \\n\\n***This is going to decimate the vehicle market.*** and by cornering the market this will make Tesla reign supreme and lord over all. Every vehicle manufacture CEO right now is already planning their ten year exit from the space and the oil industry is about to take a Rochambeau like kick in the nuts. \\n\\nTesla owns the patent tech on the new batteries so in the event another manufacture tries to compete they will have to license this battery tech from Tesla = money for Tesla. \\n\\nEvery time Tesla drops its price by 5k it doubles the available matket. They will soon produce a vehicle for 25K which will open the market up to 4x as many people as compared to today = money for Tesla. \\n\\nTesla will push other auto makers out of business by manufacturing a cheaper vehicle. This will consolidate market share = Big money for Tesla. \\n\\nEssentially this is the best news you will ever hear as an investor. It's the best 10 year play you could ever make.\\n\\nSo hold your position, stop crying and look at the big picture so you can be fucking rich! \\n\\nFor those of you still confused think about the history of the flat screen TV. The first one was damn expensive which only allowed for a select few to purchase it. Those select few that purchased it brought in money which allowed for further R&D and price reduction which opened up an even bigger class of people to afford it. That process occurred over and over and now everybody has a flat screen TV in their house. Tesla just changed the vehicle market forever.\\n\\n***edit on % of Market Cap***\\n\\n***2nd edit- With the information of how this will not be out until 2022 and probably late 2022 if not later and how everything in this market is inflated I think I'll share what I'm doing and it's either going to be selling calls on my existing shares to collect the premiums or I'll work out a put play.

Although the macroeconomic circumstances are different for the economy today vs 2009, the feelings and outlook for banks seems very similar.\\n\\nNo one wanted to touch banks, and banks were failing left and right. In addition, banks are considered too big to fail and the government refuses to let them fail under any circumstance. \\n\\nI feel the same will happen with airlines. No one can let a major airline fail. They've already received bailouts and might receive more. It's looking like there is a vaccine on the horizon and new covid infections are trending down and I think more people are taking this seriously. I think within the next 6 months we'll see new infections under 20,000/day which is 400 per state on average. People will become more willing to travel because they've been stuck inside for so long. \\n\\nI'm just curious if anyone else is buying leaps after April 2021. Also, I've noticed the volume is super low and I'm wondering how anyone is avoiding paying a much higher price because of it.\",\n",

However, we see some chinks in the armor with this report that make the stock action more understandable.\\n\\nSo why is the stock lower despite reporting upside?\\n\\nInvestor expectations were running quite high heading into this report after the stock ran from $280 in mid-March to $431 yesterday. The $0.07 beat is not as robust as recent quarters. Coming into this quarter, DPZ reported double-digit EPS beats in five of the past six quarters, including huge $0.70+ beats in Q1 and Q2. Initially, analysts clearly underestimated the beneficial impact from the pandemic on DPZ's business, but this more modest upside tells us that analyst models have gotten more realistic. Same store comps were quite good at +17.5% in the US and +6.2% internationally, which was a nice sequential improvement from Q2 (+16.1%, +1.3%). However, we think strong comps were already baked in thanks to upbeat language from DPZ last quarter. DPZ said in July that accelerated levels of demand from the middle of Q2 remained elevated through the end of the quarter. The company's main rival, Papa John's (PZZA), recently reported Q3 comps of +23.8% for North America and +20.6% for international restaurants, both of which are significantly higher than DPZ's comps.\\n\\nOverall, DPZ's earnings and comps were quite strong and the pullback in the stock today does nothing to diminish them. DPZ's business is booming as people are increasingly eating at home and looking for a quick and cheap meal. The problem is more that DPZ is a victim of its own success since the company was facing very high investor expectations with this report. Perhaps the silver lining here is that analyst models have now captured the pandemic tailwind. As a result, investors are less likely to have sky-high expectations heading into DPZ's Q4 report. So, next time a $0.70 beat will not be needed to drive the stock higher.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n",

       " 'Epic vs Apple Im constantly surprised this doesnt get more attention, but is anybody feeling like were in the middle of a heist movie or some shit with this? For those unaware Epic is suing apple because they dont want to pay 30%. On WSB I see this mostly joked off since apple is worth trillions more than Epic which if thats all youve heard makes sense on paper, more money = more legal rights duh. But the way epic is approaching the situation and from reading through the legal documents(not a lawyer but pretend i am) it seems as though the arguments presented boil down to a philosophical point of view. Appl seems within the letter of the law and Epic is clearly trying to get some law shit changed. \\n\\nBut then why all the pageantry? Why did epic specifically get banned, gun ready with legal docs and a fucking animation parody ready to go, that would surly chimp burn them if they lost? I mean obviously they wanted to get attention, but this is far from a slam dunk case, why the big dick energy? It seems to me there are 2 options. Epic is failing internally and they desperately need attention to keep the fortnight tendie dance rollin, or they have a more sophisticated plan for proceeding. I didnt think much of it either until I heard microsoft coming to bat for epic. Why did they do this? From what I gather there are concerns from them since unreal is so prevalent that if unallowed to be on the app store would require an immediate force switch of the developers in the IOS division to some other game engine, which is kind of like starting over but farther back from when you started. Devs, by which i mean the big bois, have been pushing hard for mobile and if youre deep into a \"AAA\" game on mobile the last thing you want is to get shut off from half your market unless you make a new game engine from scratch, and before you say it, soi boi beta cucks like me use unity when they are too scared to try unreal so thats not a real option for big bois.\\n\\n So Why did apple remove all the epic games and not just fortnight. Turns out it is specifically due to fortnight being taken off IOS, and not just Tim whipping out his turgid steely erection. As you may know Apple immediately removed a shit load of games that used unreal engine. They were forced to re-allow these games (but not fortnight) back on the IOS. Apple is now claiming that on IOS epic has 2 companies and that they are essentially some kind of loophole for the banned games to do exactly what fortnight did. This gives them the same letter of the law legal right to ban these apps. A large part of the argument, and why I call it philosophical, boils down to who is considered the consumer. If you didnt know having a monopoly is completely legal, but making actions to maintain this monopoly is illegal and it seems to me that one of the strongest arguments against monopolistic actions is if it directly hurts the consumer. Apple is arguing from the perspective of phone buyers and app downloaders being the consumers, while epic is arguing from the perspective of developers of apps being consumers.\\n\\n idk if epic will take it this way, but it seems to strengthen their argument tremendously if they say, \\'apple says they do this for the consumers, but look developers also are their consumers and look how many developers are being hurt through no fault of their own\\'. \\n\\nI wont lie, I think apple has a stronger case, and currently I think apple is more likely to win, but epic has some good arguments currently, imo most specifically the duopoly angle, and how apple waves the apple tax for irl shit, but If epic has a few more tricks up their sleeve something could happen. Apple has not been having real growth recently but this was masked by tax cuts. On top of  which its still up a shit ton. So im not saying apple is destined to fail, but if they do lose they lose big, as well as a lot of other software giants. I mean its like what 40% of their revenue on the line? Even if they dont lose it each pp gonna hurt, \\'daddy no\\' style.\\n\\nTLDR: Epic has at least a tiny chance of winning. If epic does win apple will lose big. But Im crazy high, and i wanna know if i sound insane. Is Sweeny Tim a Machiavellian mad lad, or just idk like a weasel fucker?',\n",

I took the time to write a proper response for once on another post only to get automoded so I\\'m posting it here because I\\'m curious what people are thinking. I really hope I\\'m not breaking any rules but please don\\'t remove this mods❤️\\n\\nThis F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around 50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn\\'t. No I\\'m not gonna post loss porn but I\\'ve got four letters for you..  H Y L N 😃🔫. Got f\\'d so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I\\'m a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.\\n\\nSo. GME. If you\\'re still reading...\\n\\n\\n**BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:**\\n\\nVideo games have multi-generational appeal. The oldest generation being 40-50 year old gen x’ers that have been playing (and developing) video games since Atari 2600 in the 70s, all the way to single-digit age kids coming to video game age every year. Babies being born provides steady supply of new gamers over time  while the older generations continue to play video games and buy games for their kids, and many have the disposable income to afford the good stuff. The total addressable market is growing and still has a couple of decades to reach full generational saturation.\\n*Courtesy of u/Mr_Saturn_*\\n\\n\\nIf we consider the company\\'s\\n\\n-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat) \\n\\n-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles\\n\\n-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I\\'m in as I\\'m sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason). On a serious note, GameStop is well known in the UK as well as in the US. They no longer operate here, however, you and I can all bet our asses that my fellow countrymen have been and shall continue FOMOing into this on any future news of a turnaround and/or deal and/or large institutional investor joining the fight and/or short squeeze becoming imminent. \\n\\n*EDIT:* Also I don\\'t believe the Blockbuster anecdote applies to GME as GameStop is operating in a thriving and evidently growing industry: the gaming industry. Brought to you by the lockdown of 2020-2021(maybe like 2022 at most right??). Blockbuster was struggling in the age of on-demand streaming. If it somehow survived til now, covid would\\'ve killed it within weeks if not days of news breaking out. Also Blockbuster no longer offered any cost-advantage to their customer. You could stream for free on pirate sites back then or pay for an emerging premium service called Netflix (who tried to buy Blockbuster but they refused the offer and got rek\\'t shortly after). The cost of said premium service per month would not even exceed the cost of renting a couple of dusty ass DVDs back then. None of these things apply to GameStop. They offer second-hand AND brand new - capturing a wide market (wider now, with the recession and all). They offer a loyalty system which isn\\'t half bad (I\\'m guessing this will change for the better anyway under new management). They can and do still offer competitive prices on many many items including consoles, games, and all sorts of gaming equipment. They are primed to make a KILLING from this console cycle. Regardless of whatever happens, don\\'t fall for this false narrative.\\n\\n**GameStop ≠ Blockbuster.**\\n\\n-possibility of acquisition of GameStop by a large retailer; think Amazon, Costco, or Walmart acquiring a recognised gaming-industry retail company (GME) with a view to becoming the single biggest retailer of games and gaming equipment by incorporating it into their existing logistical systems. I personally think if anyone ever considers this, it\\'ll be Amazon. They\\'re the only ones (I think) who could handle logistics for the massive customer base they will amass following this. Imagine buying a game from GameStop, and it arrives at your door with Prime Delivery. This would obviously be the \"home run\" so to speak. This type of news alone would, without a doubt, cause the single greatest squeeze ever witnessed. **HOWEVER, DISCLAIMER: This one is pure speculation from my side. I haven\\'t seen anything to support or even suggest this, this is purely a hypothetical situation and most likely will never be a serious topic of discussion**\\n\\n-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren\\'t making money \\n\\n-change of management  \\n\\n-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let\\'s be honest...)\\n\\n-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies \\n\\n-attempt at pivoting to e-commerce\\n\\n-Microsoft profit-sharing deal on new console sales. Guaranteed to bring in revenue above and beyond what will be generated purely by GameStop\\'s own trading of items. A deal of this type clearly shows that Microsoft NEED GameStop to keep operating - it *could* also be an indication of future deals been the two companies\\n\\n-rumoured Sony deal \\n\\n-potential for further deal(s) with more big names such as Nintendo \\n\\n-increasing retail interest \\n\\n-retail investors looking for the next success story \\n\\n-premium meme status \\n\\nI think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports, securing further deals, etc.).\\n\\nThis valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of cataclysmic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\n**BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE:**\\n\\nAssuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy\\'s PT of $500 but that\\'s probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can\\'t even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. \\n\\nSo... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. \\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\n**BEAR CASE:**\\n\\nThe company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why it would suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it\\'s really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up-to and through the initial console release period, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide), GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories.\\n\\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn\\'t absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?\\n\\nAlso, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what\\'s about to happen.\\n\\nAlso, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as previous cycles did? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won\\'t be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. \\n\\nAlso.. what do most people do when they can\\'t find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop\\'s last shot at turning it around.\\n\\nUltimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don\\'t hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\nI could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn\\'t gonna moon and who\\'s gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it. \\n\\nI would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to the ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\n**USEFUL LINKS:**\\n\\n-Explanation of how the squeeze *can* happen.

Pretty cool right? Before, if you took on too much risk, or debt, you might face consequences like high interest rates or even bankruptcy. I basically just took away that downside for everyone. Go ahead and dial up the risk. Being responsible is just another way of saying \"slow growth.\"\\n* **No Bankruptcies:** No company, state, city is going to go under.

I might let some shit businesses fail so that no once catches on, but the real shit, and the meme shit will be protected indefinitely.

We used to go down sometimes historically, but now... stonks only go up.\\n* **Employees and 1099** guys will be fine because I am just forcing the future American tax payer to pay them now. They don\\'t really have to produce or work, we will just make our future selves, the working class specifically (don\\'t worry, this only applies to average people who work themselves to death and die without any assets), work twice as hard or just pay twice as much in taxes. Either way, its their problem now. The future poor guy is paying today\\'s poor guy wages - this is pretty creative honestly and I thank Trump and Congress for their support in this regard.\\n* **Debt is free** and defaulting isn\\'t a thing. Have a mortgage? Call them up. They will give you 6 months forbearance - just say the magic words \"COVID-19\" and watch your debt obligations diminish. We will do a refi for you as well - rates are historically low! Call your credit cards and auto leases too and start crying. I know you guys are leveraged to the tits, so just push back on your creditors, they will push back on their banks, those banks push back on me, and I will buy that shit no problem. Not a big deal. And... you are welcome, but thank me later.\\n* **Nationalism** is here to stay. I am solving all this financial shit for everyone, but the printers wouldn\\'t be working this hard if China wasn\\'t eating live Pangolins that bats shit on. I mean honestly, you think we are going to be into working intimately with China? All our medical stuff, and some other critical supplies are coming from other countries - you better believe Trump is going to blame them for all our health issues and we will bring all that manufacturing back home. Expect to see US companies grow faster than international and focus your investments on Making America Great Again. Don\\'t you get it?\\n* **Oil** aint shit now and if these OPEC countries want to fuck around, I am going to print bigly and Trump is going to buy while it is low. If they fuck around too much and we will just stop buying altogether and go fully independent - which we totally can do. OK if some of those oil rig companies are going to go under, I will buy up their debt and pay their employees. Maybe Trump starts building roads and walls and those guys can do that stuff? We will figure it out, but as you can tell, none of this shit really is a big deal. I will squash it with a few trillion.\\n* **The global banking system** is quasi run by the US Fed and I can pretty much do what I want, when I want - and all the other banks globally are forced to play along. Those guys are going negative, we have the best currency and we control this shit. Some might say, I am the most powerful person in history... very cool Kanye!\\n* **Inflation is coming**, but there is a simple way to avoid it: buy financial assets. Haven\\'t you guys seen this story before? This is how we make the income gap even bigger - which side do you want to be on? You don\\'t want cash, you don\\'t want savings, you want risky assets - and this is how we win OK? The working class will be on the sidelines, getting inflated to shit, paying higher taxes and their future selves and tax dollars are making us rich today. This is the opportunity. We are taking their future money - its that simple honestly.\\n* **Start a company** if you don\\'t have one already. In case you retards haven\\'t noticed, have you seen where the vast majority of this money is going? To companies first who then decide to pay their laborers (or not?). If we wanted to help the people, we would put the money in their hands, but we don\\'t really care. For those not aware, any shitty LLC, S-corp, consulting business, cup cake stand can submit an application for a no questions asked 10k advance and free money via PPP. Oh, you don\\'t have a EIN, and don\\'t have a corporation? Go get in line for unemployment loser. See the difference? Make an LLC and mow your mom\\'s yard once a month, we will grease you bigly and then get that money into financial assets ASAP.\\n* **Social unrest** is probably coming after this honestly. We fucked everyone majorly in 2008 and got away it it for the most part, and this is like 10x 2008 so people eventually are going to get really pissed. Matt Damon will probably make a movie about it... but... it will be too late! Everyone will already be super poor and the rich will be super rich! But beware... the pitchforks are coming and you need to have that on your long term horizon.\\n* **Trump** is 100% getting re-elected. Biden is a d-d-d-d-d-dd-d-douche and Trump will shit on him on live TV soon enough. Plus, we are pumping the market bigly and the boomers aint dead yet so expect Trump 2.0 in November. You all know what he is willing to and will do to keep this stock shit pumping for his friends, amirite?\\n* **Trump\\'s second term** is going to be like letting the kid lose in the candy store. Imagine what this man will do with free debt and no need to worry about reelection? He will go HAM greasing rich dudes and you need to catch that wave the best you can. I am trying to help you here guys...\\n* **2024 After Trump:** This is when we are going to likely have to pay this shit off unfortunately. Some Bernie type person, maybe AOC, is going to show up with an army of super poor pitch fork holding proletariate and they likely will be violent at this point. They will at minimum be so poor and pissed that they actually show up to vote for left leaning candidates and all our hard work will start to be undone. These lefties are going to tax the shit out of us and probably force us into more social programs/heath care. It is going to suck, but its coming - and neither Trump nor I will be around to protect you. Puts won\\'t save you either. Who knows.\\n* **Be Irrational**: Stop using your big brains to analyze where the market should be going based on data. Instead, take a step back and consider where the market will be going cause printer go brrrrrrr. Your assumptions are not valid if the rules to the game have changed guys, and who makes the rules here? I do.\\n\\nSo what do I recommend?\\n\\nEach person\\'s situation is different, but the recipe is the same: **borrow for free, and go long on financial assets.**\\n\\nDon\\'t short the domestic market, I will indirectly destroy you and not feel bad in the slightest.\\n\\nStart a company, having an EIN is much better than just having a Social Security number. The US is all about corporations, not people - don\\'t get that confused.\\n\\nTLDR: capitalism fake now, money fake, debt free, fake rallies are real rallies. Risky assets going up, no consequences, future poor people will pay for it, lets get rich now. Plan should work next 5 years, but pivot in year 4 before the revolution comes. Prob can\\'t help you then.\\n\\nIf you guys have any questions, I am happy to answer in the comments below.  AMA!\\n\\nPS. Here is how I would roll my options the rest of 2020:\\n\\nApril: SPY 280C 5/1\\n\\nMay: SPY 290C 6/5\\n\\nJune: SPY 300 7/3\\n\\nJuly: SPY 310 8/7\\n\\nAugust: SPY 320 9/4\\n\\nSeptember: SPY 330 10/2\\n\\nOctober: SPY 350 12/25',\n",

SPCE has been a meme for a long time, but after the success of this upcoming test flight, investors will flock into it, as it is currently the only stock representing the sector of space tourism.The analysts have started raising their price target jn the last few weeks/months, and people are starting to realise the potential in this market. Once the first few test flights go right, they will start getting contracts from NASA and other agencies that need the low-orbital services, insitutional money will move in, and the hype will only grow.\\n\\nPrice Action: There was an intial hype in Feb after its IPO, which took the stock to the 40s from 10. Then it settled between 15-20 for a long time and peaked before the \"cabin reveal\" event a few months ago(ran upto 26). Again, beginning of October BoA raised its price target to $35 and in anticipation of the first test flight \"later this fall,\" stock ran up 25% in a single day. Then, with increasing uncertainty in the market and the lack of specifity with regards ro the dates of the test flight, the stock pulled back to 18.\\n\\nShort term prospects: The earnings call made a lot of promises like generating a billion dollars in revenue once they start regular low orbital flights. More importantly, they announced that the first test flight is going to take place in Nov19- 23 window. This means the stock is ready for a good run upto 20%-30% in the next 10 days.\\n\\nPOS: The smartest way to play this is to buy a shit ton of $40-50 calls for Jan 2022 now.

People get infected at protests. Riots drive away jobs. Fewer jobs means reduced government revenue. Poorer governments react worse to outbreaks and protests, and hire fewer public employees, ect. ect. Added to these trends are the presence of radicals who think that right now is the best chance they'll get to bring upon a workers revolution or the Boogaloo or a race war or whatever. They will actively try to increase internal social and political tensions.\\n\\nAtlanta Fed projects a roughly 12% GDP contraction in Q2. That's not the annualized rate - that's the total projected contraction in 90 days. The annualized rate is negative 51%. Hear that sound? That's the sound of your economy shrinking by one percent every week. This is unprecedented for any major economy in global history.\\n\\nThe collapsing economy, pandemic, mass civil unrest, and failed government response are feeding off each other. Normalcy bias makes it hard for people to imagine that systems can radically change, but they can, and sometimes very quickly. Even if somehow the US can quickly get a handle on these challenges before they get out of control, major turbulence is almost unavoidable.

I also used an RSI to show the level we are at vs 2008 as you can see it bounces from the 40 comes down through that and then this is also when the bands open up wider. Based on that it looks like 2020 has more to drop the bands haven't opened up much yet and I see the RSI dropping below 40, I drew a mock representation of the BB opening and the RSI dropping.

       " 'The new move on Monday: Puts on PG The stock market is going to open red on Monday, and probably fall this week just like before. China\\'s manufacturing is still taking a shit, the virus is spreading like crazy in France, Germany, the UK, USA, Spain, Italy, and South Korea (all of which are globally relevant nations), China\\'s new cases per day are accelerating again, and Trump told the market to fuck off on his briefing on Saturday, saying the virus is his only concern and that the stock market can take care of itself.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUnfortunately, the IV of options on all stocks is quite high lately. Look at the shit people (including myself) have options on right now - TQQQ? SPY? SQQQ? IV is huge, this means premiums are high and you\\'re making less profit because the market is essentially pricing in the probability that your put is going to be profitable.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPG is Procter and Gamble and makes a fuckload of recognizable brands of products, just go look at their list, it\\'s truly astounding. They\\'re a massive corporation. They manufacture 90% or more of their shit in the USA. But, that\\'s final manufacturing of the completed product.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGuess where the precursors and components they use to finish their products, come from?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nChina.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Nobody in the USA makes the components.

IV is lower than indexes - especially the leveraged indexes like SQQQ - and they\\'re *going* to fall more. You don\\'t need to wait for them to fall to 90 or some bullshit, you buy during a spike in the market on Monday, wait until later in the week to sell for 50% gains (which would only require about a $4 dip in their price, which is less than 4%, and the entire market including PG has experienced drops of a similar degree in intraday trading *multiple* times last week). Could hold for 100% gains, but obviously that\\'s riskier. But this is DD, not shitpost.

Listed since 2013, they have never made money and have diluted shareholders several times, after reaching ATH of 217 in 8/5 stock dropped 6% on Friday, but that is more due to a sector rotation on BigData stocks.

The premise of the video is that if someones value was only effected by their productivity, then value would increase linearly with productivity. When a person is given a loan, they have more initial value, but will have to pay it back and hence reduce there future spending (unless they are able to earn more money.) The same is true for a company which takes out a loan, they will have to cut spending in the future to pay off the loan (unless they are able to increase their productivity to earn more.)    \\n\\nThe past few years, companies earning growth have slowed down, but the value of companies kept rising  [https://imgur.com/gallery/UcT0bo6](https://imgur.com/gallery/UcT0bo6) . Companies were less likely to repay their debt burdens through productivity and kept accruing more debt. In order for companies to pay off their debt, they lay off employees. Next week, we will notice a huge surge in unemployment, due in part by the coronavirus shutdowns and corporate debt.  \\n\\nTo counteract the unemployment, the government is offering stimulus packages including: \\n\\n1. Lowering interest rates to the central bank down to 0%.\\n2. QE\\n3. Direct Payment to citizens.\\n\\nQE and low interest rates lead to inflation and an increase in asset prices if the money is used to reinvest in assets. The reason there is so much corporate debt to begin with is because of low interest rates after the 2008 crash.   \\n\\nThe big question is whether companies will take out more loans at a lower rate, in order to maintain current employees, hire more employees, and invest in assets. Seeing that companies already are seeing limited growth prior to the crash, they are likely to be more cautious which may create a spending cut cycle. Asset prices will be graded based on supply and demand. With a reduction in spending, demand will be lower, creating an increase in supply which will lower asset prices. Recessions don't last a month, this will take a long time due to the spending cut cycle. As long as the corona virus threat persists to slowdown economic activity, there will be a reduction in spending.\",\n",

Shoot for 25 for max tendies.\\n\\nGo long AXDX shares on margin, too.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn\\'t be much affected by COVD\\n\\nNow, for the real story...\\n\\n**It started with a LARGE buy that caught my eye**\\n\\nActually, a series of buys from [Jack Schuler](https://www.schulerprogram.org/staff/jack-schuler). Schuler has spent over 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, including having served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Abbott Laboratories.  Today, Mr. Schuler serves on the board of directors for several companies, including Accelerate Diagnostics, Quidel Corporation and Biodesix, Inc.\\n\\n[I\\'ll do the math for you: that\\'s $26.7MM of stock purchased during this dip. ](https://preview.redd.it/gy6yh4icti851.png?width=3106&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7772f0e78fa18ee01554cd2a9b85fff26c97aa)\\n\\nOK, so insider sales don\\'t mean everything? We don\\'t panic when we see selling because sometimes people just need to cash out. So we cannot just assume this means anything. Can we?\\n\\n**Looking back at Jack\\'s buying history - this was a v big buy for Jack**\\n\\nLooking back, Schuler is quite active in [investing in his companies](https://elite.finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1021412&tc=7). But it\\'s not always buys, he does sell. And if you look further back, you actually see some interesting things.\\n\\nStarting with AXDX: Before the buys shown above, the last time Jack made a slew of purchases was between [Aug 11 2017](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420417043378/xslF345X03/v473193_4.xml) and [May 15 2018](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420418029491/xslF345X03/tv494321_4.xml) when he purchased $29MM total. Note that this was over the course of a year for an average price of about $20 a share. Prior to those buys, you have to go back to Jan 2017 before he made any other bets.\\n\\n*In other words, Jack just bought as much stock in the last few months than he\\'d bought in the previous few years.*\\n\\nSo it seems like Jack feels really good about buying this dip. Is that enough? Probably... but let\\'s keep going.\\n\\n**Jack has been around the block - and Jack likes winning (Jack gets top $ for Ventana)**\\n\\nHe\\'s been quite successful in being an activist that fights for his shareholders. That is a great thing if you are in investor. I managed to stumble across this gem: [Jack Schuler historical record of \\'dirty tricks\\' in business](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4349&mn=39&pt=msg&mid=6732323). It\\'s truly amazing. It\\'s some dude\\'s salty manifesto about how Jack S is a actually just a bad ass investor.\\n\\nBack in 2007, Roche wanted to buy Ventana who Jack was an investor in. He has big problems with the initial price that was offered and slowed down the deal. Here\\'s what he said:\\n\\n>\"This is about stockholder value,\" said Ventana chairman Jack Schuler. \"Simply put, we believe that Roche is trying to capture value for its stockholders that rightly belongs to Ventana\\'s stockholders.\" Ironically, as Roche was hailing its offer as a 44% premium on Ventana\\'s stock value of $51.95 on June 22, 2007 (the last trading day before Roche submitted its bid to Ventana), the stock has steadily risen to a recent close of more than $83.\\n\\nPreach! He\\'s not playing dirty tricks. He wants shareholder value. What\\'s wrong with that? Long story short, the deal was hung up because Jack needed all of his tendies.  It eventually went through at a [19.3% premium to Roche\\'s initial offer on June 27, 2007](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/roche-holding-ag-to-acquire-ventana-medical-systems-inc-for-89-50-per-share-/). Well done, Jack! I\\'d certainly want him to negotiate 20% more for my shares.\\n\\n**Turns out Jack has a history of winning - Jack wins with Stericycle, Medtronic, and more**\\n\\nDigging deeper, Jack (and John Patience, the same one from the screenshot below) did the same trick with [Stericycle](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121617335185356747). The buys referenced in this article were unloaded 4-5 years later for 80-100% profits.\\n\\nHe also did it with [Medtronic in 2010](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203296004575339213130461810?tesla=y).  He picked up 30,000 shares at an average price of $36.93 each on June 25. Medtronic is at $93 today ($115 pre-covid) and pays a dividend. That ones seems to have worked out too.\\n\\nHe has other winners too. Jack. Is. A. Winner.\\n\\n**Is** ***that*** **enough?**\\n\\nHonestly, for you degens, yeah it should be. Jack has a strong track record. He thinks $10 is way too cheap, so he just bought an assload. Also, we know he doesn\\'t hate money. A man like that never starts to hate money.\\n\\n**Did I say a COVID tailwind? Yup.**\\n\\nDid I mention that they have a [COVID tailwind](https://acceleratediagnostics.com/fight-against-covid-19)? I shit you not. It keeps getting better. You know the serology tests that determine if you\\'ve had CV? That test for antibodies? Well, turns out AXDX was perfectly set up to capitalize because they can make these. And they are planning to do so!\\n\\nOn top of a slow and steady growth of sales of medical devices, which is AXDX\\'s core business, AXDX can monetize on these tests which will be really important in the coming year  as the world learns how to live with COVID (knowing who has had the disease is very important). From the CEO on the [earnings call in May:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/09/accelerate-diagnostics-axdx-q1-2020-earnings-call.aspx)\\n\\n>Lastly, through a recently signed collaboration agreement with BioCheck Ltd, we have begun commercializing the MS-FAST fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer and SARS-COV-2 test for the detection of IgG and IgM. **This partnership has the potential to provide both an avenue to reengage prospective customers on Pheno as well as a near-term revenue uplift.** The performance data for these assays are best-in-class with sensitivity and specificity estimated as exceeding 95% for both assays based on over 100 samples collected at the source of the pandemic, Wuhan, China. Since announcing the partnership on April 15, we have received several indications of interest across the global business.  \\n>  \\n>**We are continuing to work with the FDA on our emergency use authorization for commercialization in the U.S., and we have taken initial orders in EMEA.** While we are tremendously excited about this collaboration agreement and are eager to play a role in fighting this pandemic, it remains too early to estimate the revenue potential of this opportunity. In my 30 years in diagnostics, I have never experienced a period of such profound disruption. **However, with this disruption comes the creation of new opportunities, the near-term impact from this pandemic to accelerate and most other healthcare companies is significant while at the same time shining a brighter light on the value of rapid diagnostics for infectious disease.**\\n\\nAwesome! So, we are stumbling into quite a bit revenue we were not expecting. That\\'s dope. More good news? Yup. The CEO references that their **core product (Pheno) now has advantages due to COVID that will help future sales:**\\n\\n>And a big part of this will be, in my opinion, will be around how do you better manage infectious disease crises, how do you better manage secondary infections, how do you better manage bed utilization and staff utilization? And those are all things that Pheno directly addresses. I mean **Pheno gets patients on optimal therapy much, much quicker, two, three days quicker, and get patients out of the hospital two to five days quicker in some cases**. And so with that, I mean, as healthcare providers look at these things, I mean, **we fully expect them to be really having a heightened sense of interest in what we\\'re doing in this space.**\\n\\n**Is now the time?**\\n\\nI think so. First, let\\'s check AXDX over the past 5 years:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o2vw40m3j851.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd6870849fbd180cae421c934b8c6f509301dfb\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n* Lots of ups and down, but pretty consistently shoots above $20 (which will make us tendies)\\n* In 2019 (pre-covid), it easily sat in the $18-$22 range.\\n* We closed at **$15.86 today** after touching $17s yesterday and this morning. Profit raking before the weekend in the Hamptons. I\\'m not worried.\\n* Looking back in the news on AXDX, I see no cause for concern. This is just a medical device company that\\'s finally starting to see revenue.\\n\\nYou may notice the spike at the end of the chart...\\n\\n**Let\\'s zoom in to the last three months - a recent run up and dip offer a chance to buy**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiy5eew34j851.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=a868130d3e1a2449542e6822029ece6603088f4e\\n\\nIn the past month:\\n\\n* I suspect that others noticed what I have noticed, so it\\'s been up up an away.\\n* This week was especially bonkers. Up 5-10% most days. Never seen action like it.\\n* But notice that **today was a BIG DOWN** day after 6 in a row up. It had to cool off. Maybe it cools off more Monday...? It will have reasons to go up soon that have not yet materialized (more below)\\n* I see no reason why we wouldn\\'t be headed back to ranges that it was safely in last year... especially with the tailwinds due to testing revenue, Jack S\\'s confidence, and the recovery of markets (though AXDX is hardly affected by the shutdown).\\n\\n**Buy the dip, before the EUA approval!**\\n\\n***Remember those serology tests? AXDX is within weeks, by my estimate, of getting those approved for use.*** What pharma company doesn\\'t love a nice FDA approval pop?\\n\\nSo when will it happen? Some digging: if you check here, you can see that the [FDA is pumping out these approvals](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas).\\n\\nBeckman Coulter was a recent company to get the approval, this [Monday on June 29, to deliver 30MM tests a month](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-june-29-bec-sars-cov-2-igg-antibody-test-fda-eua). If you check back on their press releases, they were [chirping about this in late April](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-apr-22-bec-serology-tests). So this process for them took \\\\~2 months.\\n\\nGoing back to AXDX\\'s last conference call (May 8), we can read between the lines:\\n\\n>We **recently** filed for FDA emergency use authorization for our Pheno respiratory test kit, positioning its benefits for ventilated COVID-19 patients. If approved, this authorization will provide accelerate an avenue to reengage prospective and current customers, obtain useful analytical and clinical data on this new test and help some affected patients.\\n\\nAnd in the Q+A:\\n\\n>We have an EUA submitted, as I mentioned, for IgG and IgM combo test. We\\'re also going to be submitting an EUA for individual tests for both IgG and IgM over the next couple of days. **The FDA has already come back to us with a few pieces of data that we need to follow up on which is pretty standard.**  \\n>  \\n>And we\\'re working on that now. And in addition to that, I would say that we are submitting for a 510(k) for the MS-FAST instrument, and we\\'re working on that currently as well with the consultant. Accelerate is the authorized legal agent for BioCheck. **And so we\\'re basically spearheading all of the dialogue between the FDA and this opportunity which is a good thing because of the vast experience we have with the FDA already.**  \\n>  \\n>And so our expectation is, again I guess to be clear, t**here\\'s been no setback at all relative to our submission**. And the new guidance that has come out. And then the last thing **I would say is the performance data that we have already submitted with the FDA is excellent data. And it already meets the requirements that they have called out.**  \\n>  \\n>Our sensitivity and specificity for both the IgG and IgM test or are both very solid. And again, **we\\'re continuing to work with the FDA and hope to hear some positive outcomes here over the next couple of weeks.**\\n\\nBy the looks of it, from the statements and how press released line up, AXDX [was also writing press releases](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/accelerate-diagnostics-and-biocheck-announce-commercial-supply-and-collaboration-agreement-to-distribute-ms-fast-chemiluminescence-immunoassay-analyzer-and-sars-cov-2-antibody-tests/) in April about this, ***they applied to the FDA in late April or early May***. Given that Beckman Coulter\\'s process took about 2 months... ***I think we could be very very close to an announcement, and I\\'d certainly expect it before 7/17*** (cough - calls - cough). \\\\[I checked a few other EUA timelines, and \\\\~2 months is about right\\\\]\\n\\n**That\\'s it. What else do you need? Go buy some AXDX because:**\\n\\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn\\'t be much affected by COVD\\n\\n***What\\'s not to like?***\\n\\n**My positions**\\n\\nJacked to the tits on 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 calls expiring in July, Aug, and Nov.

During this time, many Americans and cooperation received large amount of money from the Fed.  \\n\\nThe virus itself had caused a smaller crash which previously wiped out four years of progress on the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq. Followed by severe riots across the country in which hundreds of buildings were burned and people shot.\\n\\nFollowing the crash, and the newly created money from the federal government. The market rallied, gaining back much of what was lost on wall street. But due to a massive increase in retail investment and irrational rhetoric from various internet forums, the rally went on without correction for weeks. \\n\\nBy the time the market hit its peak.

       " \"How banks and corporations hedge themselves when making new bond offerings (DD). Say you are a company in trouble, and want to offer some corporate bonds to keep yourself funded.  Things are tough, but maybe you're just certain there's someone waiting to buy your bonds at market rates.  Any such activity could potentially impact the interest rate market pushing rates up on you.  This is bad for you because it means you end up paying more when servicing your debt. \\n\\nSo to hedge against any potentially rising rates you can hedge yourself using futures.  Go short treasury futures and the profits from the short position cancel out what you lost from the rising interest rate. \\n\\nThis activity is often visible in the treasury futures.  You'll see passive sellers absorbing contracts on the offer.  They try to be sneaky about it because they don't want the market hitting into the bid and moving price down on them before they are fully hedged. \\n\\nAlso since I'm sure it will come up it's about $500 margin per contact to trade treasury futures.  The most liquid contact is the 10 year (ZN), and that's where I look for such hedging activity.  You make $15.625 per tick in the treasury and it's slow making things manageable for newbies.  There's also ZB and UB which are worth more per tick and move further, but are not as liquid.  There are many brokers, but I recommend a broker that specializes in futures if you want to play in this market.\",\n",

       " 'Short Shopify, Long Square [2020 Tech Bubble DD] Shopify is currently valued at nearly 20x the entire hosted e-commerce market. Furthermore, they\\'re neither the fastest growing nor have the best retention rates. In fact they have a lower retention rate than all but Wix and roughly half of first place Ecwid. For anyone here that actually bothers to read SEC filings and looked at their 20Q1 results you may have noticed that they announced they\\'re redirecting growth resources into merchant solutions, but what you probably didn\\'t bother checking is that merchant solutions have less than half the margins of subscription solutions.\\n\\nThe difference is that subscription solutions is essentially all the money they generate through software related to hosted online stores. This segment of their business is basically Wordpress for business, and it\\'s a lot more literal than you would think given the market leader (by a sizeable amount and with a far higher retention rate) is WooCommerce -- literally a free and open source plugin for Wordpress. Merchant solutions on the other hand are more correlated with how well performing its stores are rather than how many they have. Essentially they know they stand to benefit far more from improving the relationships and business of their higher performing stores rather than expanding further into lower performing one. I\\'ve got a lot more details in my upcoming article on Seeking Alpha, it\\'s currently with the editorial board but if you\\'ve read this far and want more you can [read it as a blog in the meantime](https://hastebin.com/owaqupomoz.apache).\\n\\nNow where does Square come into this? Well [my only other post in this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf1alu/shopify_20_wix/) was also related to Shopify, when I recommended Wix at around $130. Obviously my timing was terrible on the short position, and maybe it is this time too, but Wix is trading at over $280 today. My strategy for hedging hyper bubbles like Shopify is to simply find high growth tech stocks that are nowhere near as expensive and, as long as this market continues, just pretty much wait for them to become a hyper bubble. Square is growing at \\\\~45% since IPO, same growth rate as Shopify FY19 but exponential rather than the annual declines of Shopify who is projected for 36% FY20. On top of that, Shopify had a $135 million net loss from their $1.73 billion trailing revenue while Square is recently profitable with a net income of $307 million from their $5.135 billion in revenue.\\n\\nSo you\\'ve got a company growing just as quickly, with the benefit of being exponential, already roughly 3x larger, and is currently trading at \"only\" 10.5x in comparison to Shopify at more than 65x. On another note, [Twitter ripped a couple weeks ago on a subscription platform job listing](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/twitter-stock-rises-more-than-8percent-on-potential-subscription-platform.html). Dorsey owns both Square and Twitter so I\\'ll give you three guesses who will benefit the most from that. Of course this hedge, as it was with Wix, only makes sense while this 2020 tech bubble continues with everyone chasing high growth like it\\'s 1999. Short Shopify at your own peril, my price target is $118 so it\\'s got a long way to go, but I\\'m blown away by how resilient it\\'s been. There\\'s no way to time how long this irrational stupidity will last, but you can certainly outsmart it in the meantime.\\n\\ntl;dr - Short Shopify if you\\'ve got balls of steel, long Square as a hedge if you think this market insanity will continue. Price target on Shopify is $118 so it\\'s got a long way to go if you want to wait for momentum shift. Square is growing at the same rate (while being exponential rather than declining and actually earns money), it would be roughly $815 per share if it reached the same insane sales multiple as Shopify. If it somehow managed to reach Zoom\\'s even more incredible sales multiple it would touch $1,225 per share.\\n\\n\\\\*I posted my SA article on Hastebin because WSB blocks the site. The reason cited is because the payment structure incentivizes spam, but in my case it\\'s posted as a blog which doesn\\'t have any payment structure.

Based on an improved version of my model, the UK trial should be well over 50 events by now, even if we assume 100% efficacy. I suspect management is waiting for the original 66 event threshold in the clinical trial protocol due to the massive increase in COVID cases in the UK. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nToday\\'s US Phase 3 trial announcement didn\\'t generate much of a reaction but all vaccine stocks have traded down over the course of the day. The value in this announcement is that we know that the FDA has approved their manufacturing process and release testing assays, which takes away some downside risk. I suspect that the lukewarm response to the trial announcement may be due to the misconception that NVAX is much further behind than they really are bc of the failure to understand that the UK trial is what really matters. The US trial needs to be run to support eventual full approval in the US, but not for emergency use authorization and global licensure and that\\'s what really matters. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hoped the trial announcement today would have been a bigger catalyst, but this still all comes down to the UK interim update. If efficacy is >90% then this will take off. I haven\\'t started rolling my Jan 15 calls and probably won\\'t start unless we get to mid-week next week and we still don\\'t have an update.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders. For those who didn’t read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), I’m currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have >5yrs of experience in vaccine R&D.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDue to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN\\'s trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBased on \\\\*current\\\\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX\\'s Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# If all of this is true why is NVAX\\'s market cap so low?\\n\\nI suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX\\'s low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn\\'t started.\\n\\n**The market doesn\\'t seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.\\n\\nAlthough it\\'s not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?\\n\\nThe UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that\\'s been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they\\'ll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.\\n\\nA positive interim readout (anything >90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAX’s $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOk, so when will we get 50 events in the trial?\\n\\nThe official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected \"as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region.\" However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they\\'ll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission.\\n\\nSince I have >90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it\\'s semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK\\'s Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. I’m including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background\\n\\nUsing public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) aren’t counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that\\'s not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654\\n\\nBecause the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22\\n\\nI divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4\\n\\nThe modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what we’ll see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. I’m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.\\n\\n**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**\\n\\nI think this is reasonable, however I don\\'t have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Conclusion and Final Predictions\\n\\nWe can debate NVAX’s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I’ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.\\n\\nThe success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they\\'re announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.\\n\\nI wouldn’t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we’re close to the bottom. I’m not comfortable missing an announcement so I’m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.\\n\\nI’ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn’t great so I’ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.\\n\\nIf your risk tolerance isn’t high then regular shares aren’t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there’s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Final Predictions**\\n\\n· Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec\\n\\n· 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\----------------------------------------\\n\\nUpdate\\n\\nRegarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942\\n\\nThat was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",

These were my last three: [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t3_gf9cr0), [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/), [Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gignio/two_big_earnings_plays_for_maximum_tendies_rcl/). These three posts included 4 plays, $MTCH, $SDC, $RCL, and $PLT. 3 out of 4 of these would have netted you 200-500% profit, while $PLT was a break even play due to bad timing (market crashed for two days after I had posted/bought in, price dropping unrelated to the actual company itself). So with a decent track record, I wanted to just discuss my next earning play. \\n\\n## Intro, Lets Talk Tech\\n\\nSo during the coronavirus lockdown, you'd think sales would be pretty low in this space? Well yea... with that, all stocks dropped in value but many have rebounded. The market crashed, *recession, remember?* Focusing on tech stocks alone, consider the pre-covid19 price compared to now, many companies in this sector have successfully rebounded from the market's crash and have achieved new highs. Consider LOGI's [6-month chart](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi) sitting nicely at ATH or even [AAPL](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl) which is getting there. Tech stocks have done extremely well in the last month and a half or so. All tech stocks have also had a very good earnings run-up prior to their earnings report. But you probably don't want to buy calls for a stock that's at or above it's pre-covid19 levels. We're also looking for stocks that have a bit of time before they release their earnings so we can play the run-up. So let me show you [HPQ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpq). \\n\\n## HP Inc. (HPQ) \\n\\nAs you guys know, HP is a tech company that sells laptops, printers and other related products. Earnings is on [May 27th, 4:05 pm](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/hpq). I want you guys to directly compare it's 6-month chart to other tech companies: https://i.imgur.com/QkEkdrp.png\\n\\nNote how HPQ didn't quite have the recovery that all the other examples show? This allows for a lot of room to play the earnings run-up. As mentioned, tech companies have done extremely well, so with the stock currently sitting at $16.60ish I expect HPQ to easily hit $17.50. Possibly run as high as $18. Most investors will also be considering the increase in sales that have happened in the latter half of the lockdown due to people having to buy laptops and peripherals or upgrade to work from home. Also, on [Friday HP declared a $0.1762/share quarterly dividend, a forward yield of 4.74%](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/HP+Inc.+%28HPQ%29+Declares+%240.1762+Quarterly+Dividend%3B+4.8%25+Yield/16893847.html), but you would need to buy in before June 9th to get in on this. Because of this, we should see an extra load of people buying shares for earnings run-up this week *and to* capture the dividend before selling (if they sell at all). It's also worth noting that there was a high chance HP Inc [was going to be bought out by Xerox at $24/share](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/03/02/hp-reviewing-24-per-share-offer-from-xerox.html), but the deal was canceled over covid19. It's probable that the offer will be put forth again, which would be absolutely amazing for long-term shareholders. People reeling from covid19 crash should consider this a great buy, especially now, right before earnings. All of this just adds to the growing list of reasons to get calls as soon as possible. \\n\\n## Big Moves\\n\\nThere have been a lot of Hedge fund activity regarding HPQ lately, including Baupost hedge fund doubled stake in HPQ to 2 million shares. As for unusual options activity: on Friday, [there was a 5x increase in daily call purchases](https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2020/05/15/hp-sees-unusually-high-options-volume-nysehpq.html), meaning investors are anticipating a possible strong move in the share price leading up to earnings. Strong activity especially at the 17, 17.5 and 18c. \\n\\n## What I'm Doing\\n\\nI've already bought 15c last week and [talked about this play 3 days ago on my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/AveenoFresh/comments/gkedb5/so_this_is_my_next_earning_play_dd_will_be_posted/). I'm considering double dipping and getting more, but not now. Hence the title, that this ticker is on my *watchlist*. I'll probably buy in on the next dip, possibly something not so ITM. Should you get 15c too? Nah. Someone just wanting to play the run up and snatch some quick gains before selling prior to earnings and risk a lot less capital in a run up to earnings should go for $16.5c 5/29. The 6/5 exp date contracts are worth looking at too. Yes, it’s a week after earnings, but HPQ should gain through earnings, possibly spike after, dip some, and then hold those gains in a run towards the dividend release I mentioned earlier for 6/9. The 6/5 contract gives an extra week of protection for market volatility and for the shares to come back for anyone ballsy enough to hold through earnings and try to capture further buying from dividend seekers. \\n\\nShares are currently at the high 16s with 6 trading days until earnings report after hours. You guys should be careful of market volatility as it interfered with my PLT buy from last week. My price target in a run up to earnings is $18/share. If earnings are good as expected then there will be a slight bump AH and maybe a little selling for profit taking the day after, but a lot of investors will hold shares through that special June 9th date and the shares may even increase more from there.\\n\\nIf you do buy into this play, I'm suggesting most hold til the day of earnings and those will brass balls who really want to gamble can hold through earnings. Time value will be a major factor with these options expiring just two days after earnings. \\n\\n**tldr** Put this stock on your watchlist, buy on the next dip. I'm looking at $16.5c 5/29 and $17.5c 6/9. Typing this from my HP laptop.\",\n",

In addition, Bed Bath announced a new $150 million        accelerated share repurchase program. It will be added to the $225        million buyback plan launched in October, which it has largely        funded from noncore asset sales.     \\n\\nThe shares closed down in regular trading Monday, but are up 1.9% to $19.23        at recent check. Bed Bath has gained more than 9% year to date, rising        nearly six-fold from its lows in March.     \\n\\nAnalysts were largely happy with the news. Raymond James\\'s Bobby        Griffin reiterated a Strong Buy rating and $26        price target on the shares. He writes that the sale dovetails well with        management\\'s strategy to focus on its flagship brands, and calls        concerns that the lack of disclosure about the price is \" shortsighted,\"        given its strong balance sheet. \"Accordingly, at this point, the        monetization of Cost Plus is not needed as a core part of the investment        thesis and is just extra capital for an incremental accelerated share        repurchase plan,\" he says.     \\n\\nRobert W. Baird\\'s Peter Benedict reiterated an        Outperform rating and $50 price target, writing that        following the sale, Bed Bath\\'s \"portfolio restructuring \\\\[is\\\\] seemingly        complete.\" He notes that some investors might have been disappointed        that the release didn\\'t include any update for the third quarter, but        overall it was good news: \"With a streamlined portfolio of assets and        strong balance sheet, Bed Bath has the focus and financial flexibility        to drive its business transformation over the next few years.\"     \\n\\nTelsey Advisory Group\\'s Joseph Feldman reiterated        an Outperform rating and $28 price target. He says the        sale will allow Bed Bath to focus on its four key categories: home,        beauty, wellness, and baby. \"Looking ahead, the planned initiatives --        which target merchandising, pricing, stores, supply chain, digital, and        technology -- should result in a smaller, but more profitable Bed        Bath & Beyond by 2023.\"     \\n\\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at [teresa.rivas@barrons.com](mailto:teresa.rivas@barrons.com) \\n\\n (END) Dow Jones Newswires   12-15-20 1019ET   Copyright (c) 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \\n\\nTechnicals: \\n\\n[Currently flat with no significant up or downtrend.](https://preview.redd.it/e9zkcisjje561.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b18b60931e01a2cebe0071a05609b994ee951e)\\n\\nStrategy: This is a long term buy and hold type of option position.  $50 is a bit ambitious near term but it certainly could hit that number within a year.

The deal is touted to be worth $30 billion, reflecting a 16% premium to the stock’s Oct 8 closing price. Shares of AMD fell 3.9% last Friday following the report, while Xilinx stock rallied more than 14%.\\n\\n Now, AMD’s interest in Xilinx, which specializes in making FPGAs chips that can be reprogrammed and are primarily used in the communications, data center, industrial and defense applications, is anticipated to intensify the competition with Intel in the FPGA market. \\n\\n The performance of Xilinx’s AlveoAI accelerators is considered as powerful as NVIDIA’s data-center graphic processing units (GPUs).

       " \"CEMI: Get ready to moon you degenerates, $15+ incoming! Well well well...looks like you degenerates didn't listen and are missing out on the gravy train here. CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.\\n\\nHighlights of what you have missed since my last post:\\n\\n* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System\\n* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.\\n* Craig Hallum upgraded CEMI as a buy today for $10 PT\\n\\nThat BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.\\n\\nOn top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.\\n\\nStill long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.\\n\\n**----Previous Post on 10/16----**\\n\\nListen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:\\n\\n* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.\\n* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)\\n* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered in\\xa0the United States\\xa0immediately.\\n\\nTheir platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \\\\~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.\\n\\nAny partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \\\\~$4.62.\\n\\nGood luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.\\n\\nTL;DR: CEMI target share price of $15+\",\n",

       " \"Acadia Healthcare Corp - NYSE: ACHC I know that no one here likes real DD. But this company is going to fall apart.\\n\\nAcadia Healthcare Corp (ACHC) is a company that provides inpatient and outpatient behavioral medical care in the US, UK, and Puerto Rico. This includes psychiatric facilities, addiction centers, and other programs or treatment centers for people with behavioral / psychological problems. ACHC will be going bankrupt, or experiencing material degradation of their underlying business, in the next two years.\\n\\nRegardless of how they are able to perform, the debt coming due relative to their cash flow is insurmountable. They are already a mature company, so there is no chance to grow their way out of the issue in which they find themselves. Historical revenue growth has been in the single digits. With COVID in 2020 and many elective treatments being delayed, their performance in 2020 will be muted at best. Based on Q1 2020 results, their performance this year is already expected to be worse than prior years. Here is a snapshot of their cash flow (2020 RR = Q1 2020 x 4 to annualize):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zyrr7k7f2e851.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c3beac1b9de8375fd356bc920c89aa73b23ee3\\n\\nNow pay attention, there is an important concept in that picture, because levered free cash flow is basically how much money we can expect the company to generate to pay future debt, after they pay all other obligations and necessary business expenses. Let's be generous and say that by some miracle ACHC is able to produce $100 million of levered FCF per year for each year into the future. That is higher than any level seen in the prior three years by about 2x. That level of cash flow is unlikely, as revenue is not moving anywhere fast, EBITDA appears to be flat, cash interest will not decline until debt is due, capex looks consistent (you need equipment and facilities!), and taxes are... taxes.\\n\\n**Capital Structure**\\n\\nSo now that we know what their cash flow profile looks like, let's take a look at their capital structure. Looking at ACHC's debt, they are challenged in two ways: upcoming maturities and financial covenants. They have substantial maturities coming in the next three years, and do not have the cash on hand to cover the maturities ($181 million in cash after they pulled on their revolver).\\n\\nOn top of that, and this is important to remember, the company also has financial covenants. ACHC has to meet a Consolidated Debt / EBITDA ratio, which is essentially total debt divided by their EBITDA. Long-term, they are only able to support debt that totals 5.0x their EBITDA. For 2020 (due to COVID), ACHC had to negotiate with their creditors to increase the Consolidated Debt / EBITDA covenant to 6.25x, declining to 5.25x in 2021, and 5.0x each year after. If Acadia reports EBITDA that causes their leverage ratio to be above the covenant, they have to i) negotiate a waiver from their lenders, or ii) default on their debt. REMEMBER THIS. This is a guillotine that is always waiting over the company ready to drop.\\n\\nNow, unfortunately for the company, their debt just matures too damn fast. Here is a breakdown by total dollar value of maturities with timing, noting that this does not include the small debt amortization payments made along the way, which will be a use of cash and a reduction of what's due (just timing):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04ulwjvmae851.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc57367c5befeb35bfd04a0066633aedaa5b6f21\\n\\nYou can see the kill shot is in 2023. But it is actually much worse. The cash Acadia produces will not come close to being enough to pay for anything. Even if Acadia used its entire revolver. Even if Acadia doubled it's freaking cash flow every year they could not pay for jack shit. DOUBLING CASH FLOW IS AN INSANE ASSUMPTION AND THEY ARE STILL SHORT $240 MILLION. IN EXAMPLE 2, CASH FLOW GROWTH IS LESS INSANE, BUT STILL MORE CASH THAN THEY HAVE EVER MADE, AND **THEY MISS BY OVER $1 BILLION.**\\n\\n[\\\\*2021 - 2023 levered FCF is still 4 times higher than what the company has ever generated.](https://preview.redd.it/6emrp6kb2e851.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=a748da106fc3a936f5c6652e1258d866e7d5f52f)\\n\\n**Solutions to ACHC's Problems**\\n\\nOkay, RestructurKing, you are right, this looks like shit. Can't they just refinance though? In Insane scenario, probably yes, fair enough, they'll be okay. But the risk with refinancing is, you guessed it, the MFing covenants. If you just refinance shit, it will always be due later, and you will never improve against your covenant, which reduces to 5.0x in 2022.\\n\\n*Situation 1 -* If ACHC refinances the 2021 debt, they are still at $3.3 billion in debt on $550 million in EBITDA at the end of 2021, which is 6.0x. Unless they grow EBITDA to $660 million (20% YoY growth), they are donzo. No chance to grow EBITDA though, because they couldn't grow it at all the last three years without COVID, so they are extra fucked. Boom, blew a fucking covenant day god damn one.\\n\\n*Situation 2 -* ACHC somehow pays down the 2021 debt with the cash they can't generate (using the revolver to pay debt would keep debt constant). Total debt is $2.9 billion now in 2022.\\n\\n* EBITDA is still $550 million? Oops, blew the fucking covenant again (2,900 / 550 = \\\\~5.25x).\\n* EBITDA is at least $580 million? Okay, no covenant default. Oops, still need to find $455 million of cash to pay down debt. They don't find it? Boom, bankruptcy.\\n* ACHC does find the cash? Excellent, player advances to 2023. $1.5 billion of debt is due. No cash? Bankruptcy.\\n\\nThey will not last through 2023. They will have to pay down $794 million in 2021 and 2022, more than 10 times their best levered free cash flow year from the last three years. Based on historical performance, they will never generate that amount of cash.\\n\\nIn short, the only way for the company to cover their maturities is to cut uses of cash, like capital expenditures. Cutting necessary business expenses would undermine business operations, which would ultimately cause a decline in performance and thus stock price.\\n\\n**TL;DR** Lots of upcoming debt maturities and no cash flow. Acadia's options are to do the following:\\n\\n1. Refinance - They only kick the can down the road, and are always subject to a 5.0x leverage covenant which they currently cannot meet. ACHC will default. Share price falls.\\n2. Can't Refinance - Company cannot generate enough cash to pay down debt and risks default in 2021, likely in 2022. Share price falls.\\n3. Cut Necessary Expenses - Company undermines its own business model by cutting important business expenses to cover debt. Share price falls on poorer performance.\\n\\nEDIT: Left out position sizing. To some commenters’ points, this is tough to buy options on. I am short $5k shares currently (20% of portfolio). I would only recommend shorting shares right now to deal with COVID volatility and the fact that the market has not fully recognized what will happen to ACHC. I am trying to get you guys in on the ground floor, and timing the precipitous drop of a bankruptcy filing is challenging because the process can start 18 months before filing or three weeks, you just can’t know. As the maturities get closer I will begin buying puts, because the immediacy will cause much shorter term price declines and I won’t have to worry about volume on the options as much. I plan to start looking at puts 1 month out beginning in January 2021.\",\n",

BUT china claims only 200ish people have died so far...Math says untrue. Here i explain.\\n\\nThe average mortality rate is ~8 people per 1000 in a year, so if we multiply 8×1000 to get our million people annual death rate of 8000...now we divide that by 365. That would bring us to ~21 people dying each day per million. Multiplying that by roughly 11 would get us our 11 million population death rate, we get 231 people dying per day out of 11 million on average. \\n\\nSo 231 people will die on an average day there without da flu. So in order to run out of body bags, the death rate must have substantially increased in wuhan. \\n\\nTDLR. China sus. I deserve to be mod. Where's my gold. Long $TSLA.\",\n",
